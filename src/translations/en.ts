        question: "What is Purrify?",
        answer:
          "Purrify is an activated carbon cat litter additive that eliminates odors at the source, rather than masking them with fragrances.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does Purrify work?",
        answer:
          "Purrify uses activated carbon technology to trap and neutralize odor molecules through adsorption, effectively eliminating cat litter odors at the molecular level.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does Purrify last?",
        answer:
          "A single application of Purrify can keep your litter box odor-free for up to 7 days, depending on usage and the number of cats.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can Purrify be used with any type of cat litter?",
        answer:
          "Yes, Purrify works with all types of cat litter including clay, clumping, crystal, and natural litters.",
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I use Purrify?",
        answer:
          "For best results, sprinkle Purrify on top of your cat's litter each time you change or add fresh litter. A thin layer is all you need for continuous odor control.",
      },
      {
        question: "How long does one bag of Purrify last?",
        answer:
          "This depends on how many cats you have and how often you change their litter. On average, our 65g bag lasts about 1-2 months for a single cat household with regular litter changes.",
      },
      {
        question:
          "How is Purrify different from scented litters or deodorizers?",
        answer:
          "Unlike scented products that mask odors, Purrify uses activated carbon technology to actually trap and neutralize odor molecules at the source. It doesn't add any scent to your home - it simply eliminates the bad ones.",
