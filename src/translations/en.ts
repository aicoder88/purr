    items: [
      {
        question: "What is Purrify?",
        answer: "Purrify is an activated carbon cat litter additive that eliminates odors at the source, rather than masking them with fragrances."
      },
      {
        question: "How does Purrify work?",
        answer: "Purrify uses activated carbon technology to trap and neutralize odor molecules through adsorption, effectively eliminating cat litter odors at the molecular level."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I use Purrify for rodents like hamsters, mice, or rats?",
        answer: "Yes! Purrify uses the same type of activated carbon found in hospital water filtration and veterinary applications. When used properly in sealed pouches or containers with proper ventilation, it can be suitable for odor control in rodent environments. Always minimize dust exposure and rinse before use if needed. For detailed usage guidelines and precautions for small pets, see our complete safety information page.",
        link: "/learn/safety"
      },
      {
        question: "How long does Purrify last?",
        answer: "A single application of Purrify can keep your litter box odor-free for up to 7 days, depending on usage and the number of cats."
      },
      {
        question: "Can Purrify be used with any type of cat litter?",
        answer: "Yes, Purrify works with all types of cat litter including clay, clumping, crystal, and natural litters."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I use Purrify?",
        answer: "For best results, sprinkle Purrify on top of your cat's litter each time you change or add fresh litter. A thin layer is all you need for continuous odor control."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does one bag of Purrify last?",
        answer: "This depends on how many cats you have and how often you change their litter. On average, our 50g bag lasts about 1-2 months for a single cat household with regular litter changes."
      },
      {
        question: "How is Purrify different from scented litters or deodorizers?",
        answer: "Unlike scented products that mask odors, Purrify uses activated carbon technology to actually trap and neutralize odor molecules at the source. It doesn't add any scent to your home - it simply eliminates the bad ones."
      },
      {
        question: "Is Purrify certified? Where can I find safety information?",
        answer: "Yes! Purrify meets NSF/ANSI 61, AWWA B604, and Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) standards. It's also Halal and Kosher certified. For complete technical specifications, certifications, and detailed safety information including rodent usage guidelines, visit our safety information page.",

        },
        {
          question: "How much Purrify should I use?",
          answer: "For optimal results, use approximately 1-2 tablespoons of Purrify per standard litter box. Mix it thoroughly with your existing litter when you do a complete change. The 12g trial size is perfect for one litter box change."

      question: "What is Purrify and how does it work?",

      headline: "Common Questions About Ammonia Control",
      q1: "How does Purrify control ammonia?",
      a1: "Purrify uses activated coconut carbon with millions of microscopic pores that trap ammonia molecules through adsorption. Unlike baking soda or fragrances that mask odor, activated carbon physically captures and holds ammonia so it never reaches your nose.",
      q2: "Is activated carbon safe for cats?",
      a2: "Yes, activated carbon is 100% natural and non-toxic. It's the same material used in water filters and air purifiers, and has been safely used around pets for decades. Purrify contains no chemicals, fragrances, or additives.",
      q3: "How much Purrify do I use?",
      a3: "Simply sprinkle a thin layer over your cat's litter and mix it in. One 50g pouch treats a standard litter box for about 7 days. For multiple cats, use our 120g size.",
      q4: "Does it work with all litter types?",
      a4: "Yes! Purrify works with clumping clay, non-clumping, crystal, paper, wood, and corn-based litters. It enhances any litter's odor control.",
      q5: "How is Purrify different from baking soda?",
      a5: "Baking soda only neutralizes some odors temporarily and needs constant reapplication. Activated carbon physically traps ammonia molecules through adsorption, providing 7+ days of protection from a single application.",
      q6: "Will it eliminate existing odors?",
      a6: "Purrify immediately starts absorbing ammonia from the moment you add it. Existing odors typically disappear within 24-48 hours as the activated carbon absorbs them.",
      q7: "Is it safe for kittens?",
      a7: "Absolutely. Purrify is safe for cats of all ages. There are no chemicals or fragrances that could irritate young or sensitive cats.",
      q8: "How long does one bag last?",
      a8: "The 50g pouch lasts about 7 days for one cat. The 120g pouch lasts about 7 days for multi-cat households (2-3 cats). Most customers find they need to change litter less often."
