          "answer": "Purrify is an activated carbon additive for cat litter that eliminates odors at the molecular level. The activated carbon has millions of microscopic pores that trap and neutralize odor-causing compounds, providing superior odor control compared to traditional litter alone."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can Purrify be used around cats and people?",
          "answer": "Purrify uses the same type of activated carbon commonly found in household water and air filtration. It contains no added fragrances or dyes."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much Purrify should I use?",
          "answer": "For optimal results, use approximately 1-2 tablespoons of Purrify per standard litter box. Mix it thoroughly with your existing litter when you do a complete change. The 12g trial size is perfect for one litter box change."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Purrify work with all types of litter?",
          "answer": "Yes! Purrify is designed to work with any type of cat litter - clay, clumping, crystal, natural, or biodegradable. It enhances the odor control properties of whatever litter you're already using."
