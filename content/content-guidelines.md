# Purrify Content Writing Guidelines

**Purpose:** This document contains reusable writing principles for all Purrify content (blog posts, marketing, social media). Claude Code MUST reference these guidelines when creating any product-related content.

---

## 1. Technical Terms & Audience Sensitivity

### The Mercaptans Rule
While scientifically accurate, technical chemistry terms can be off-putting to general audiences.

| Avoid (Technical) | Use Instead (Accessible) |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Mercaptans | Sulfur-based compounds |
| Volatile organic compounds | Organic waste molecules |
| Adsorption | Molecular trapping |
| Microporous structure | Microscopic tunnels/pores |

**Exception:** Use technical terms in content targeting cleaning enthusiasts, science-minded readers, or when establishing authority (then explain simply).

### Professional Terminology for Sensitive Topics

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Poo, poop | Solid waste, organic matter |
| Pee, urine (overuse) | Liquid waste, ammonia sources |
| Stink, stench | Odor, smell |
| Gross, disgusting | Unpleasant, problematic |

**Tone:** Clinical but warm. We're professionals who understand cat parents' real struggles.

## 2. Safety & Legal Messaging

### NEVER Use These Words for Safety Claims
- "Safe" (legally loaded)
- "Hypoallergenic" (requires testing)
- "Veterinarian approved" (unless documented)
- "Clinically proven" (requires studies)

### ALWAYS Use These Alternatives

| Instead of "Safe" | Use |
|-------------------|-----|
| Food-grade | Implies safety through standards |
| Non-toxic | Factual material property |
| Pet-friendly | Focuses on design intent |
| 100% natural | Material origin |
| Fragrance-free | Absence of irritants |
| Chemical-free | No additives |

### The Water Filter Analogy (Primary Safety Hook)
> "Made from the same high-purity activated carbon used in residential drinking water filters"

**Why it works:**
- Implies safety without claiming it
- Leverages existing consumer trust
- Factually accurate
- Creates instant credibility

**Usage:** Include in every piece of content discussing product safety or materials.

### The NASA Connection (Authority Hook)
> "Utilizing the same molecular trapping technology NASA relies on for breathable air in closed-loop environments like the ISS"

**Why it works:**
- Massive "cool factor"
- Implies extreme performance standards
- Scientifically accurate (activated carbon is used in spacecraft air systems)
- Appeals to science-minded consumers

**Variations:**
- "Space-station grade air purification"
- "The same technology astronauts rely on"
- "NASA-trusted molecular filtration"

**Caution:** Don't claim NASA endorsement or partnership. State the technology connection only.

## 3. Core Educational Framework

### "Why Masking Doesn't Work" (Use in Every Odor-Related Post)

**The Problem (establish pain point):**
1. Standard litters absorb liquid but don't trap gas
2. Perfumes add more chemicals without removing odors
3. Scented products can stress cats' sensitive respiratory systems
4. "Nose blindness" means owners can't tell if it's working

**The Solution (introduce molecular trapping):**
1. Activated carbon physically removes odor molecules from air
2. Microscopic pores trap molecules on contact
3. Works passively - no reactions, no residue
4. Targets the source, not the symptom

### The Football Field Analogy
> "One gram of activated carbon has the surface area of a football field, filled with microscopic tunnels that trap odor molecules on contact"

**Usage:** Include whenever explaining how activated carbon works. It's memorable and shareable.

## 4. Product Benefit Hierarchy

When listing benefits, use this order consistently:

### Primary Messaging (Always Include)
1. **Cat-Friendly First** - No scents or chemicals to irritate paws or noses
2. **High-Performance** - Same standards as water and air filtration
3. **Simple to Use** - Just a sprinkle on top of existing litter

### Secondary Messaging (Include When Space Allows)
4. **Long-Lasting** - 7+ days of freshness
5. **Works with Any Litter** - Clay, crystal, natural, whatever your cat prefers
6. **Eco-Conscious** - Made from renewable coconut shells

### Tertiary Messaging (Use Selectively)
7. **Cost-Effective** - Less litter changes needed
8. **No Lifestyle Changes** - Your cat won't notice the difference
9. **Guest-Ready Home** - Confidence when visitors arrive

---

## 5. Storytelling Frameworks

### The "Cat Parent Journey" (Personal Narrative)
Use this structure for relatable content:

1. **The Struggle** - "I tried everything..."
2. **The Failed Solutions** - Scented litters, baking soda, air fresheners
3. **The Discovery** - Learning about real odor science
4. **The Science** - How activated carbon actually works
5. **The Result** - Fresh home, happy cat, peace of mind

### The "Myth vs. Reality" (Educational)
Use for SEO-focused content:

1. **Common Belief** - What most people think
2. **Why It's Wrong** - The science behind the myth
3. **The Truth** - What actually works and why
4. **The Solution** - How Purrify addresses this

### The "Problem-Agitate-Solve" (Marketing)
Use for conversion-focused content:

1. **Problem** - Identify the specific pain point
2. **Agitate** - Emphasize consequences (embarrassment, stress, health)
3. **Solve** - Present Purrify as the science-backed solution

## 6. Audience-Specific Tailoring

### For Cat Health Communities (r/CatAdvice style)
**Focus on:**
- Cat respiratory health
- Stress-free litter box habits
- Natural, fragrance-free benefits
- NASA air quality angle

**Avoid:**
- Heavy chemistry terminology
- Cleaning-focused language
- Technical jargon without explanation

### For Cleaning Enthusiasts (r/CleaningTips style)
**Focus on:**
- Chemistry of odors (can use "mercaptans" here)
- Home hygiene and air quality
- Water filter safety angle
- Technical performance metrics

**Avoid:**
- Overly emotional cat-parent language
- Basic explanations of simple concepts

### For General Audiences (Blog, Social Media)
**Focus on:**
- Relatable struggles
- Simple science explanations
- Practical benefits
- Visual analogies (football field, water filter)

**Avoid:**
- Assuming prior knowledge
- Technical terms without context
- Lengthy scientific explanations
