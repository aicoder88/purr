The ammonia smell from urine and the bacteria from feces can quickly make your home uncomfortable. But with the right approach, you can eliminate these odors effectively.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border-l-4 border-blue-400 dark:border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8\">\n                <h4 class=\"font-bold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100 mb-2\">💡 The Source of the Smell</h4>\n                <p class=\"text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200\">\n                  Urine odor is primarily caused by ammonia, which forms when bacteria break down urea. Fecal odors come from sulfur compounds produced during digestion.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short</h2>\n              \n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Many cat owners try masking odors with scented litters or air fresheners, but these only provide temporary relief. The key is to <strong>eliminate odors at the source</strong> rather than covering them up.\n              </p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">The Problem with Scented Litters</h3>\n              \n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Scented litters often contain artificial fragrances that can irritate both you and your cat. Some cats may even avoid using a litter box with strong scents, leading to accidents outside the box.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"mb-8\">\n                <img src=\"/optimized/activated-carbon-granules.webp\" alt=\"Close-up of activated carbon granules for odor elimination\" />\n                <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 text-center mt-2\">\n                  Activated carbon: The natural solution for neutralizing odors\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Science of Activated Carbon</h2>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Activated carbon is a natural, highly porous material that traps odor molecules through a process called <strong>adsorption</strong>. Unlike absorption (where liquids are soaked up), adsorption means odor molecules stick to the surface of the carbon particles.\n              </p>\n\n              <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n                <li><strong>Millions of tiny pores</strong> create a massive surface area</li>\n                <li><strong>Odor molecules are trapped</strong> and neutralized</li>\n                <li><strong>No chemicals</strong> or artificial fragrances needed</li>\n                <li><strong>Safe</strong> for cats and humans</li>\n              </ul>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Using Purrify for Maximum Results</h2>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Purrify's activated carbon formula is specifically designed for cat litter odor control.
