Ideally, that is where it clumps. If your deodorizer is sitting on the surface, it is miles away from the smell source. You need to get the carbon *into* the litter matrix.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Master Class: Step-by-Step Application</h2>\n\n  <div class=\"space-y-8 mb-12\">\n    \n    <div class=\"flex items-start space-x-4\">\n      <div class=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-[#FF3131] dark:bg-[#FF6B6B] text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-xl\">\n        1\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"flex-1\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">The Clean Slate</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n          Never apply fresh deodorizer to a dirty box.

Applying to Wet Litter</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-red-800 dark:text-red-200\">Activated Carbon stops working when it gets wet (the water fills the pores). Always apply to dry granules.</p>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-2\">2. Ignoring Humidity</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-red-800 dark:text-red-200\">Storing your bag open in a bathroom allows the carbon to adsorb shower steam. Keep the bag SEALED.</p>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-2\">3. Over-Mixing</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-red-800 dark:text-red-200\">If you mix it too deep, it settles at the bottom where it can't trap airborne smells.</p>\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n        <h4 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-2\">4. Using Baking Soda</h4>\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-red-800 dark:text-red-200\">Don't mix chemical deodorizers. They can clump and react safely compared to pure carbon.</p>\n     </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The \"Vertical Scent Trap\": Understanding Airflow</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Ammonia gas is lighter than air, meaning it rises. However, the odor molecules from feces are often heavier and sink. To trap both, you need a vertical strategy. By mixing carbon into the middle layer (trapping urine gas) and keeping a light dusting on the surface (catching rising fecal gasses), you create a three-dimensional filter that air must pass through before it reaches the rest of your home.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">When to Re-Dose: Listening to the Box</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    The 5-day rule is a great baseline, but every cat is different. If you have a larger cat or a high-protein diet, you may need a \"Mid-Week Boost.\" If you notice a faint sharp scent on Day 3, don't wait for Day 5. Add a single tablespoon and mix just the surface. This \"top-up\" refreshes the adsorptive capacity of the box without requiring a full reset.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Why Granule Size Matters: The Purrify Geometry</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Most cheap carbon additives use a \"powder\" format. While this looks like it would mix well, it actually falls to the bottom of the box instantly, leaving the top layer unprotected. Purrify uses a specific **Granular Mesh Size** that is matched to the weight and density of standard clay litter. This ensures that the carbon stays suspended throughout the litter matrix rather than settling. This \"suspension\" is what allows the carbon to intercept gas molecules as they rise from a clump, providing a 360-degree shield that powder simply cannot offer.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Storage Logic: Keeping Your Carbon \"Empty\"</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Activated carbon is constantly working. If you leave the bag open in your laundry room, it will start adsorbing the scent of detergent and moisture from the air. By the time you sprinkle it in the litter box, its \"pores\" are already 30% full of laundry scent, making it less effective at catching ammonia. Always store your Purrify in a cool, dry place and ensure the zip-lock or cap is sealed tight. You want the carbon's first \"meal\" to be the ammonia in your litter box, not the ambient humidity in your basement.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Conclusion</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    You have the right product; now use the right technique. By using the \"Sandwich Method\" and mixing your carbon into the top layer, you transform your litter box from a scent broadcaster into an odor trap.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-[#FF3131]/10 dark:bg-[#FF3131]/5 border border-[#FF3131]/20 dark:border-[#FF6B6B]/30 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8\">\n    <h4 class=\"font-bold text-[#FF3131] dark:text-[#FF6B6B] mb-3\">🏆 Get the Right Tools</h4>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n        Purrify's Family Pack comes with a pre-measured scoop to make dosing precise and easy.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"/products\" class=\"inline-block px-8 py-3 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full font-bold text-lg hover:bg-red-600 transition-all transform hover:scale-105 shadow-xl\">\n      Shop Purrify Now →\n    </a>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n</div>",
