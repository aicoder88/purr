Remove all old litter and wash the box with mild soap and water. Dry completely before proceeding. A clean starting surface ensures maximum contact between the deodorizer and odor-causing compounds.</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n                  <div class=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-xl\">2</div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-2\">Add Base Layer of Litter</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200\">Pour 2-3 inches of your regular cat litter into the clean box. This creates the foundation layer that will work with your deodorizer additive. Use your cat's preferred litter type, ensure even distribution across the box, and don't overfill—leave room for mixing.</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n                  <div class=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-xl\">3</div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-2\">Sprinkle Deodorizer Evenly</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-3\">Sprinkle the activated carbon litter additive evenly across the entire surface of the litter. Use:</p>\n                    <ul class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 space-y-1\">\n                      <li>• 1 tablespoon for small litter boxes</li>\n                      <li>• 1.5 tablespoons for medium boxes</li>\n                      <li>• 2 tablespoons for large boxes</li>\n                      <li>• Add 0.5 tablespoon per additional cat in multi-cat households</li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n                  <div class=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-xl\">4</div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-2\">Add Top Layer of Litter</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200\">Add another 1-2 inches of litter on top of the deodorizer. This creates a sandwich effect that maximizes odor control while keeping the additive in place. The layered approach ensures that the deodorizer makes contact with odors from both above and below.</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"flex items-start gap-4\">\n                  <div class=\"flex-shrink-0 w-12 h-12 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full flex items-center justify-center font-bold text-xl\">5</div>\n                  <div>\n                    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-2\">Mix Gently (Optional)</h3>\n                    <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200\">Lightly mix the top layer with a clean scoop to distribute the deodorizer throughout the litter. Be gentle to avoid creating dust clouds. Some cats prefer unmixed litter, so observe your cat's preference.</p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-6\">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\n\n              <div class=\"space-y-4 mb-12\">\n                <div class=\"bg-red-50 bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 border-red-700 rounded-lg p-5\">\n                  <h3 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 text-red-100 mb-2\">❌ Using Too Much</h3>\n                  <p class=\"text-red-800 text-red-200 text-sm\">More isn't better. Excess deodorizer can deter cats from using the box. Stick to recommended amounts.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"bg-red-50 bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 border-red-700 rounded-lg p-5\">\n                  <h3 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 text-red-100 mb-2\">❌ Adding to Dirty Litter</h3>\n                  <p class=\"text-red-800 text-red-200 text-sm\">Always start with fresh, clean litter. Adding deodorizer to soiled litter reduces effectiveness.</p>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"bg-red-50 bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 border-red-700 rounded-lg p-5\">\n                  <h3 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 text-red-100 mb-2\">❌ Irregular Refreshing</h3>\n                  <p class=\"text-red-800 text-red-200 text-sm\">Activated carbon saturates over time. Refresh every 5-7 days for optimal performance.</p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-[#FF3131]/10 border border-[#FF3131]/20 rounded-lg p-6\">\n                <h3 class=\"font-heading text-xl font-bold text-[#FF3131] text-[#FF6B6B] mb-3\">Pro Tip: The Purrify Difference</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Purrify's activated carbon is specifically sized for optimal litter box performance—fine enough to maximize surface area, but coarse enough to minimize dust and tracking. One container lasts 4-6 weeks for single-cat households.</p>\n                <a href=\"/products\" class=\"inline-block bg-brand-red-600 text-white text-gray-900 px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-brand-red-700 transition-colors text-gray-900\">Get Purrify →</a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div><figure class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/optimized/blog/fresh-home-hero-ghibli.webp\" alt=\"Clean apartment home with cat after consistent litter odor control routine\" class=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 text-gray-400\">A consistent scooping and additive routine keeps homes fresher between litter changes.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- editorial-enhancement-v1-en -->\n<section class=\"my-10\">\n  <h2>7-Day Action Plan to Improve cat litter deodorizer guide</h2>\n  <p>Compelling odor control comes from consistency, not random product switching.
