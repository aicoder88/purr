When urine sits for more than a few hours,\n                bacterial activity converts urea into ammonia gas. That gas bonds quickly to fabric, drywall, and even\n                stainless steel. If your cleaning routine skips a single layer—ventilation, absorption, or neutralization—the\n                smell rebounds within hours.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 my-10\">\n                <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 border border-[#E0EFC7] dark:border-[#E0EFC7]/30 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-sm dark:shadow-none\">\n                  <h3 class=\"text-lg font-semibold text-[#5B2EFF] dark:text-[#C4B5FD]\">1. Saturation</h3>\n                  <p>Overfilled litter traps moisture against the base.
