In a confined litter box, this gas concentrates to levels 10x higher than fresh air. The smell you notice is literally ammonia gas reaching your nose.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-orange-50 bg-orange-900/20 border border-orange-200 border-orange-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n                  <h3 class=\"font-bold text-orange-900 text-orange-100 mb-2\">Problem 2: Saturated Litter</h3>\n                  <p class=\"text-orange-800 text-orange-200\">Standard litter has limited absorption capacity. Once saturated, urine pools at the bottom, creating a continuous ammonia source that scooping can't remove.</p>\n                </div>\n\n                <div class=\"bg-yellow-50 bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 border-yellow-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n                  <h3 class=\"font-bold text-yellow-900 text-yellow-100 mb-2\">Problem 3: Poor Air Circulation</h3>\n                  <p class=\"text-yellow-800 text-yellow-200\">Enclosed spaces, closets, or corners trap ammonia. Without airflow, odors concentrate and linger long after the initial source is removed.</p>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Layered Solution</h2>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-4\">Layer 1: Deep Clean (Day 1)</h3>\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Start fresh. Remove all litter, wash the box with enzyme cleaner (not just soap), and let it dry completely. If the box is over a year old, replace it—plastic absorbs odors permanently.</p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-4\">Layer 2: Activated Carbon Base (Day 1)</h3>\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Add 2 tablespoons of activated carbon to the bottom of the clean box before adding litter. This creates a trap layer that captures ammonia as it seeps down.</p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-4\">Layer 3: Quality Litter (Day 1)</h3>\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Use 3-4 inches of unscented clumping litter. Unscented is key—fragrances mask odors temporarily but don't eliminate them. The clumping action isolates waste faster.</p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-4\">Layer 4: Airflow Management (Ongoing)</h3>\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Move the box to a well-ventilated area. Run a small fan nearby (pointed away from the box) to keep air moving. Never place in closets or small enclosed spaces.</p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 text-gray-50 mb-4\">Layer 5: Maintenance Schedule (Ongoing)</h3>\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-6\">Scoop twice daily. Add 1 tablespoon of fresh carbon every 5 days. Complete litter changes every 2 weeks (not monthly).</p>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-[#FF3131]/10 border border-[#FF3131]/20 rounded-lg p-6\">\n                <h3 class=\"font-heading text-xl font-bold text-[#FF3131] text-[#FF6B6B] mb-3\">When to See a Vet</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-gray-700 text-gray-200 mb-4\">Sudden increases in urine odor can indicate health issues: urinary tract infections, kidney disease, or diabetes. If the smell changed suddenly or your cat is urinating more frequently, schedule a vet visit.</p>\n                <a href=\"/products\" class=\"inline-block bg-brand-red-600 text-white text-gray-900 px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-brand-red-700 transition-colors text-gray-900\">Get Purrify →</a>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div><figure class=\"my-8\"><img src=\"/optimized/blog/fresh-home-hero-ghibli.webp\" alt=\"Clean apartment home with cat after consistent litter odor control routine\" class=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption class=\"mt-2 text-sm text-gray-500 text-gray-400\">A consistent scooping and additive routine keeps homes fresher between litter changes.</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- editorial-enhancement-v1-en -->\n<section class=\"my-10\">\n  <h2>7-Day Action Plan to Improve how to stop ammonia smell cat litter</h2>\n  <p>Compelling odor control comes from consistency, not random product switching.
