Something caught my attention: how do astronauts deal with air quality in a sealed environment where you literally cannot open a window?\n              </p>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                The answer wasn't perfumes or chemical neutralizers. It was <strong>molecular trapping</strong>.\n              </p>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                In space, you can't just \"cover up\" odors. You have to physically remove the odor molecules from the air. And one of the key technologies NASA uses for this? Activated carbon.\n              </p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">Wait\u2014Carbon?

Activated carbon is charcoal that's been processed to create millions of microscopic pores. These pores create an enormous internal surface area\u2014we're talking about <strong>one gram of activated carbon having the surface area of a football field</strong>.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border-l-4 border-blue-400 dark:border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8\">\n                <h4 class=\"font-bold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100 mb-2\">The Football Field Analogy</h4>\n                <p class=\"text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200\">\n                  Imagine a single gram of material\u2014about the weight of a paperclip\u2014with more surface area than an entire football field. Every bit of that surface is covered in microscopic tunnels that trap odor molecules on contact. That's activated carbon.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                These microscopic tunnels work through a process called adsorption (not absorption\u2014there's a difference). Instead of soaking up liquids like a sponge, activated carbon attracts and holds gas molecules on its surface. Ammonia, sulfur compounds, organic waste molecules\u2014they all get trapped in these tiny pores and can't escape back into the air.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"my-12 text-center\">\n                <img src=\"/optimized/micropores_magnified_view.webp\" alt=\"Activated carbon micropores magnified - how cat litter deodorizer traps ammonia and odor molecules\" class=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-4\">\n                <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2\">\n                  Microscopic pores in activated carbon act as molecular traps for odor-causing compounds\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Water Filter Connection</h2>\n              \n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Here's where things got really interesting for me.
