You clean regularly, so you assume there's no smell—but visitors experience it fresh. This disconnect causes embarrassment when guests react to odors you genuinely can't detect.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-md\">\n                <h3 class=\"font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2\">How do I know if my house smells like cat?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">Leave your home for at least 2 hours. When you return, pay close attention in the first 30 seconds before your nose adapts. Alternatively, ask a trusted friend who doesn't live with you for honest feedback. If you can smell anything in that first moment, guests definitely notice.</p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 shadow-md\">\n                <h3 class=\"font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 mb-2\">Can I have cats without my house smelling?</h3>\n                <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">Absolutely. Millions of cat owners maintain odor-free homes. The key is source control: quality litter with activated carbon, twice-daily scooping, proper ventilation, and treating any accidents immediately. It requires consistent effort, but a fresh-smelling cat home is achievable.</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n      </div>",
