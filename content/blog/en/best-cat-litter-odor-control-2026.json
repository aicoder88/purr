We rank <strong>technologies</strong>. No matter which brand you buy, it will likely be one of the four categories below. Each category has a specific strength, but all share a common weakness: they absorb liquid but struggle with the gas molecules (ammonia) that escape between clumps.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Top 10 Litter Technologies Compared</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"space-y-12 mb-16\">\n      \n      <section class=\"border-b border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-800 pb-12\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">#1 Premium Sodium Bentonite (Clay)</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n          The industry standard for a reason.
