The porous structure traps odor molecules\n                  inside microscopic pores, physically removing them from the air. A single gram of activated carbon\n                  can have a surface area of over 3,000 square meters—roughly the size of half a football field.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-orange-50 dark:bg-orange-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg\">\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-orange-800 dark:text-orange-200\">\n                  Baking Soda\n                </h3>\n                <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300\">\n                  Works through <strong>pH neutralization</strong>. Alkaline properties neutralize acidic odor\n                  compounds, reducing their smell intensity. However, this only works on acid-based odors\n                  and does nothing for alkaline compounds like ammonia.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50\">\n              The Ammonia Problem: Why Baking Soda Falls Short\n            </h2>\n\n            <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n              Here's the critical issue that many cat owners don't realize: <strong>cat urine produces ammonia, which is alkaline</strong>.\n              Baking soda is also alkaline. Basic chemistry tells us that an alkaline substance cannot neutralize another alkaline substance—they simply don't react.\n            </p>\n\n            <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mt-4\">\n              This explains why baking soda seems to work initially but loses effectiveness quickly. It may neutralize some of the weaker acidic compounds\n              in fresh urine, but as bacteria break down the waste and ammonia levels rise, baking soda becomes essentially useless.\n

Laboratory results are one thing, but what matters most is real-world performance.

Baking soda absorbs moisture and neutralizes fresh acidic compounds,\n              while activated carbon begins trapping odor molecules.
