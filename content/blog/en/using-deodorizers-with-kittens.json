Here is how to keep their box fresh without compromising their health.\n  </p>\n  <div class=\"flex items-center justify-center space-x-4 mt-6 text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\">\n    <span>Updated February 2026</span>\n    <span>\u2022</span>\n    <span>7 min read</span>\n  </div>\n</header>\n\n<div class=\"mb-12\">\n  <img src=\"/optimized/blog/kitten-looking-curious-ghibli.jpg\" alt=\"Tiny kitten looking curiously at a litter scoop in Ghibli style\" class=\"w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg\" />\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"bg-yellow-50 dark:bg-yellow-900/20 border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-12\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-yellow-900 dark:text-yellow-100 mb-4\">⏳ The Golden Rule</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-yellow-800 dark:text-yellow-200 mb-4\">\n    <strong>Wait until 8 Weeks.</strong> Before this age, kittens are prone to eating litter. Only introduce additives (even natural ones) once they have mastered the concept that \"Litter = Toilet, Not Food.\"\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Why Kittens Are More Sensitive</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    A 2-pound kitten processes toxins differently than a 10-pound cat. Their respiratory rate is faster, meaning they inhale more air (and dust) per minute relative to their size.\n  </p>\n  <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n    <li><strong>Pica Risk:</strong> Kittens explore with their mouths. They may try to eat scented crystals or clumps.</li>\n    <li><strong>Developing Lungs:</strong> Heavy perfumes or dusty clay can trigger early-onset asthma.</li>\n    <li><strong>Chemical Sensitivity:</strong> Their liver is still developing and cannot filter harsh chemicals found in cheap deodorizers.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Safe vs. Unsafe Ingredients</h2>\n  \n  <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-12\">\n    <div class=\"bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 border border-green-200 dark:border-green-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n      <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-green-900 dark:text-green-100 mb-4\">✅ Safe for Kittens (8+ Weeks)</h3>\n      <ul class=\"text-green-800 dark:text-green-200 space-y-3\">\n        <li><strong>Activated Carbon:</strong> Inert, non-toxic, and passes through the system if accidentally ingested.</li>\n        <li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> Natural bacteria that eat odor.</li>\n        <li><strong>Food-Grade Enzyme Sprays:</strong> Safe even if licked.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n      <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-4\">❌ DANGEROUS for Kittens</h3>\n      <ul class=\"text-red-800 dark:text-red-200 space-y-3\">\n        <li><strong>Clumping Sodium Bentonite:</strong> If eaten, it can expand in the stomach and cause a blockage.</li>\n        <li><strong>Essential Oils:</strong> Tea Tree, Peppermint, and Citrus oils are toxic to felines.</li>\n        <li><strong>Silica Beads:</strong> Choking hazard and desiccant risk.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Timeline: When to Introduce Odor Control</h2>\n\n  <div class=\"space-y-8 mb-12\">\n    <div class=\"flex items-start\">\n        <div class=\"w-32 flex-shrink-0 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50\">Weeks 0-4</div>\n        <div>\n            <strong class=\"block text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50\">Mom or Foster Care</strong>\n            <p class=\"text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300\">Mother cat stimulates elimination.

Here is how to manage it without chemicals:\n  </p>\n  <ol class=\"list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 space-y-4\">\n     <li><strong>Scoop Immediately:</strong> Kittens poop frequently (3-4 times a day). Scoop as soon as possible to prevent habits of stepping in waste.</li>\n     <li><strong>Small Open Box:</strong> Use a small, shallow pan without a lid. Covered boxes trap odors that can scare a kitten away from using the box ever again.</li>\n     <li><strong>Use Carbon, Not Scent:</strong> Perfume teaches a kitten that \"Flower Smell = Toilet.\" This leads to confusion later when you use floral laundry detergent. Carbon is scent-neutral.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <img src=\"/optimized/blog/mother-cat-kitten.jpg\" alt=\"Mother cat watching kitten use litter box illustration\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12\" />\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">What If My Kitten Eats the Carbon?</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Don't panic. Activated carbon is used in emergency veterinary medicine to treat poisoning because it adsorbs toxins in the stomach. \n  </p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    If your kitten licks their paws after using Purrify, it is generally harmless. However, you should discourage them from eating Granules directly. If they treat the litter box like a snack bowl, switch to a corn or paper litter immediately and consult your vet.</p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Conclusion</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Kittens are resilient, but they are also delicate. By waiting until the 8-week mark and choosing a biologically inert deodorizer like Purrify Activated Carbon, you protect their lungs and digestion while saving your nose.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-[#FF3131]/10 border border-[#FF3131]/20 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8\">\n    <h4 class=\"font-bold text-[#FF3131] dark:text-[#FF6B6B] mb-3\">\ud83d\udc3e Safe for Tiny Paws</h4>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n      Purrify is fragrance-free, chemical-free, and safe for kittens over 8 weeks. Start their life off fresh.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"/products\" class=\"inline-block px-8 py-3 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full font-bold text-lg hover:bg-red-600 transition-all transform hover:scale-105 shadow-xl\">\n      Shop Purrify Family Pack \u2192\n    </a>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n</div>",
