Heat Accelerates Ammonia Evaporation</h3>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Cat urine contains <strong>urea</strong>, which bacteria break down into <strong>ammonia</strong>. This is the molecule responsible for that sharp, eye-watering smell.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6\">\n                <h4 class=\"font-bold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100 mb-3\">The Temperature Effect:</h4>\n                <p class=\"text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200 mb-4\">\n                  For every <strong>10°C (18°F) increase in temperature</strong>, the rate of chemical reactions—including ammonia production—roughly <strong>doubles</strong> (known as the <strong>Arrhenius Equation</strong>).\n                </p>\n                <ul class=\"text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200 space-y-2\">\n                  <li><strong>At 15°C (59°F):</strong> Moderate ammonia evaporation</li>\n                  <li><strong>At 25°C (77°F):</strong> 2x faster ammonia release</li>\n                  <li><strong>At 35°C (95°F):</strong> 4x faster ammonia release</li>\n                </ul>\n                <p class=\"text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200 mt-4 font-semibold\">\n                  This is why your litter box that smelled fine in March is unbearable in July—even though nothing else changed.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n\n              <h3 class=\"font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">2. Bacterial Activity Increases in Heat</h3>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                The bacteria that convert urea to ammonia (<em>urease-positive bacteria</em>) thrive in warm conditions, with replication rates peaking between 25°C and 40°C. They work faster and produce more ammonia per hour.\n              </p>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Think of bacteria like tiny workers. In winter, they're sluggish and slow. In summer, they're in overdrive, churning out ammonia at maximum speed.\n              </p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">3. Hot Air Holds and Distributes More Odor Molecules</h3>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Warm air is <strong>less dense</strong> than cold air, meaning odor molecules spread through your home faster. Plus, warm air rises—carrying ammonia from the litter box throughout your living space.\n              </p>\n\n              <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-700 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8\">\n                <h4 class=\"font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-3\">Why You Notice It More in Summer:</h4>\n                <ul class=\"text-red-800 dark:text-red-200 space-y-2\">\n                  <li><strong>Faster evaporation:</strong> Ammonia escapes the litter faster</li>\n                  <li><strong>More bacterial activity:</strong> More ammonia is produced per hour</li>\n                  <li><strong>Better odor distribution:</strong> Warm air spreads the smell farther</li>\n                  <li><strong>Closed windows:</strong> Air conditioning traps odors inside</li>\n                  <li><strong>Higher humidity:</strong> Moisture amplifies ammonia perception</li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n\n              <h2 class=\"font-heading text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">4 Proven Solutions for Summer Cat Litter Smell</h2>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Now that you understand <em>why</em> summer makes odors worse, here's <em>what to do about it</em>:\n              </p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"font-heading text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">Solution #1: Use Activated Carbon (Non-Negotiable in Summer)</h3>\n\n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                If there's <strong>one solution</strong> that works in hot weather, it's activated carbon.
