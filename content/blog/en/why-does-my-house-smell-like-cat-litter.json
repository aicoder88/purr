They don't stay in the box—they escape into the air and travel through your HVAC system. True elimination requires molecular trapping technology, not just adding perfume to the air.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Why Cat Litter Smell Spreads Throughout Your Home</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n      Cat litter odor comes from two molecular culprits that escape at the speed of airflow:\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-8\">\n      <div class=\"bg-red-50 dark:bg-red-900/20 border border-red-200 dark:border-red-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-red-900 dark:text-red-100 mb-3\">Ammonia (From Urine)</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-red-800 dark:text-red-200\">\n          Bacteria break down urea into ammonia gas. This creates that sharp, eye-watering smell. It releases <strong>47 minutes</strong> after your cat uses the box.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 border border-purple-200 dark:border-purple-700 rounded-lg p-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-purple-900 dark:text-purple-100 mb-3\">Sulfur (From Feces)</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-purple-800 dark:text-purple-200\">\n          Organic waste produces sulfur-based compounds—similar to rotten eggs. These are incredibly potent; even tiny amounts trigger our noses' warning systems.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">6 Reasons Your Home Still Smells</h2>\n\n    <div class=\"space-y-6 mb-12\">\n      <div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 pb-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">1. Fragrance Masking Failure</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n          Scented litters and air fresheners fade within 24-48 hours. Meanwhile, the underlying odor continues building. You end up with <strong>perfume AND cat smell</strong>—worse than either alone.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 pb-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">2. Shallow Litter Depth</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n          Less than 3 inches of litter can't absorb urine properly before it reaches the box bottom. Once it hits the plastic, bacteria multiply exponentially in the scratches.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"/optimized/litter-depth-science.webp\" alt=\"Diagram showing 3-4 inches as the optimal odor-trapping depth\" class=\"w-full max-w-md mx-auto rounded-lg\" shadow-sm border>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 pb-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">3. Poor Box Location</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n          Boxes near HVAC returns spread odor throughout your entire home. Boxes in small, humid bathrooms allow ammonia to release faster into the air.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"my-10 text-center\">\n        <img src=\"/optimized/fresh-home-cat-panorama.webp\" alt=\"A wide-angle Ghibli-style fresh, sunlit home interior\" class=\"w-full h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-4\">\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 text-center mt-2\">\n          The Goal: Freshness that reaches every corner of your home.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 pb-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">4. Not Enough Boxes</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n          The N+1 rule applies: one box per cat plus one extra. Overused boxes saturate litter faster than it can dry, creating constant ammonia release.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 dark:border-gray-600 pb-6\">\n        <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-3\">5. The \"Scratched Plastic\" Trap</h3>\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n          Old litter boxes have thousands of microscopic scratches from cat claws. Ammonia and bacteria soak into these crevices where soap and water can't reach. Replace boxes annually.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Solution: Molecular Adsorption</h2>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n      True elimination requires capturing molecules before they escape. Activated carbon technology does exactly this—it's the same method used in high-purity drinking water filters and hospital air filtration systems.\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-8 mb-12\">\n      <h3 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4 text-center\">The Scale is Staggering</h3>\n      <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 items-center\">\n        <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n          One gram of activated carbon contains millions of microscopic tunnels. The surface area is equivalent to <strong>4 football fields</strong>. This provides massive capacity for capturing the gases that escape from your litter box.\n        </p>\n        <img src=\"/optimized/activated-carbon-football-field-scale.webp\" alt=\"Scale comparison: one gram of carbon vs 4 football fields\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm\">\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"my-10 text-center\">\n        <img src=\"/optimized/nose-blindness-reset.webp\" alt=\"A person walking into a home and being hit with a fresh scent versus a cat smell\" class=\"w-full max-w-md mx-auto h-auto rounded-xl shadow-lg mb-4\">\n        <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-500 text-center mt-2\">\n          Stop Guessing: If you have to ask if it smells, it likely does.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Your 5-Minute Freshness Audit</h2>\n    <ul class=\"space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n      <li><strong>1. Open a window:</strong> Leave for 20 minutes, then return. The first 3 seconds when you walk back in are when your nose reset is most sensitive.</li>\n      <li><strong>2.
