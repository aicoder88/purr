The 100-Day Test\n  </h1>\n  <p class=\"text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto\">\n    We tracked ammonia spikes for 100 days to find the scientific \"sweet spot\" for deodorizer application. Stop wasting product and stop tolerating smell.\n  </p>\n</header>\n\n<div class=\"mb-12\">\n  <img src=\"/optimized/frequency-hero-ghibli.jpg\" alt=\"Scientist cat tracking litter box data on a clipboard\" class=\"w-full rounded-xl shadow-lg\" />\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"prose prose-lg max-w-none\">\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Great Deodorizer Question</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Ask 10 cat owners how often they add deodorizer, and you'll get 10 different answers. \"Every day!\" \"When it smells.\" \"Every time I change the bag.\" \n  </p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    The problem is that waiting until \"it smells\" means you've already failed. The human nose detects ammonia at around 5-10 ppm (parts per million), but your cat? They smell it at levels far lower, causing stress and potential litter box avoidance long before you notice a thing.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The 100-Day Experiment</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    I wanted definitive answers. So, I set up a controlled experiment across three households:\n  </p>\n  <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n    <li><strong>Household A:</strong> 1 Cat (Male, 12lbs)</li>\n    <li><strong>Household B:</strong> 2 Cats (Siblings, 10lbs & 11lbs)</li>\n    <li><strong>Household C:</strong> 3 Cats (Mixed ages/sizes)</li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <div class=\"bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8\">\n    <h3 class=\"font-bold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100 mb-2\">Test Protocol</h3>\n    <ul class=\"list-none space-y-2 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200\">\n      <li>\ud83e\uddf9 <strong>Litter:</strong> Unscented clumping clay (same brand)</li>\n      <li>\u23f1\ufe0f <strong>Scooping:</strong> 2x Daily (8 AM / 8 PM)</li>\n      <li>\ud83d\udca8 <strong>Deodorizer:</strong> Purrify Activated Carbon (2 tbsp dose)</li>\n      <li>\ud83d\udcc8 <strong>Measurement:</strong> Digital Ammonia Gas Sensor placed at box rim height</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n\n  <img src=\"/optimized/ammonia-chart-ghibli.png\" alt=\"Chart showing ammonia spikes over 14 days with different frequencies\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-8\" />\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Data Results</h2>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">Single-Cat Home: The 5-7 Day Rule</h3>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n    In Household A, we found that a single application of 2 tablespoons of Activated Carbon effectively kept ammonia at 0 ppm for exactly 5 days. \n  </p>\n  <ul class=\"list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200\">\n    <li><strong>Day 1-4:</strong> 0 ppm (undetectable)</li>\n    <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> 0-1 ppm (trace)</li>\n    <li><strong>Day 6:</strong> 2-3 ppm (noticeable to cat)</li>\n    <li><strong>Day 7:</strong> 5+ ppm (noticeable to human)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    <strong>Verdict:</strong> Refresh every 5 days for perfect air, or every 7 days if you want to stretch your budget (but risk slight odor).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">Multi-Cat Home: The 3-Day Rule</h3>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-4\">\n    For Household B and C, the curve was much steeper. With double the urine output, the carbon saturation point was reached much faster.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    <strong>Verdict:</strong> Every 3-4 days is mandatory. Waiting a full week resulted in ammonia spikes of 20+ ppm, which is stressful for cats and embarrassing for owners.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Danger of \"Nose Blindness\"</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Why rely on a schedule instead of your nose? **Olfactory Fatigue.** \n  </p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Your brain is programmed to ignore constant background smells to stay alert for new dangers (like smoke). This means your house could smell like a litter box right now, and you honestly wouldn't know it until a guest walks in and makes a face.\n  </p>\n  <img src=\"/optimized/nose-blindness-ghibli.png\" alt=\"Illustration of nose blindness mechanism\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-8\" />\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">How to Apply for Maximum Efficiency</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Dumping deodorizer on top looks satisfying, but it's inefficient. Here is the technician-approved method to make your product last longer:\n  </p>\n  \n  <div class=\"grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 mb-8\">\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700\">\n       <div class=\"text-4xl mb-4\">\ud83e\uddf9</div>\n       <h4 class=\"font-bold mb-2\">1. Scoop First</h4>\n       <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300\">Never add deodorizer to a dirty box. Remove the waste clumps to reduce the immediate ammonia load.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700\">\n       <div class=\"text-4xl mb-4\">\u2728</div>\n       <h4 class=\"font-bold mb-2\">2. Sprinkle Thin</h4>\n       <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300\">Use 1-2 tablespoons. A thin, even dusting is better than a single pile.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700\">\n       <div class=\"text-4xl mb-4\">\ud83d\udd04</div>\n       <h4 class=\"font-bold mb-2\">3. Mix It In</h4>\n       <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300\">This is crucial. Mix the carbon into the top 2 inches. This prevents it from being buried too deep or sitting uselessly on top.</p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <img src=\"/optimized/application-technique-ghibli.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing correct mixing technique\" class=\"w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-12\" />\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The \"Reset\" Protocol: When the Schedule Fails</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Even with a perfect 5-day or 3-day schedule, there are times when your litter box will hit a saturation point. This usually happens after a bout of feline diarrhea or when a cat is on medication that significantly changes their urine chemistry.\n  </p>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    If you follow the schedule but still detect a sharp ammonia spike on Day 2, do not just add more deodorizer. You need to perform a **Partial Reset**:\n  </p>\n  <ol class=\"list-decimal pl-6 mb-8 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 space-y-4\">\n    <li><strong>The Core Swap:</strong> Remove 2 inches of the most used litter (usually the center front).</li>\n    <li><strong>Scrub the Base:</strong> Use a dry paper towel to check for liquid that might have seeped to the bottom.</li>\n    <li><strong>Carbon Foundation:</strong> Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of carbon directly onto the plastic/metal floor of the box before adding fresh litter back in.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Automating Your Odor Control</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Consistency is the hardest part of litter box management. Most owners start strong but eventually forget a dose, leading to a smell that takes days to neutralize again. \n  </p>\n  <div class=\"bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900/20 p-6 rounded-lg mb-8\">\n    <h4 class=\"font-bold text-green-900 dark:text-green-100 mb-2\">\u23f0 The Smart Phone Solution</h4>\n    <p class=\"text-green-800 dark:text-green-200\">\n      Set a recurring calendar event on your phone for every Wednesday and Sunday (for multi-cat) or just every Saturday (for single cat). Label it \"Purrify Refresh.\" When the notification hits, it takes exactly 30 seconds to sprinkle and mix. \n    </p>\n  </div>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Troubleshooting Your Frequency: The \"Sniff Test\"</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    If you find that our 5-day or 3-day recommendations aren't working for you, it is time to look at **Saturation Variables**. Not all urine is the same. Cats on a kibble-only diet often have higher nitrogen waste, leading to sharper ammonia. High humidity (above 60%) or a box located in a poorly ventilated bathroom will also cause the carbon to fill up faster as it adsorbs moisture from the air. If you notice a faint sharp scent before your scheduled refresh, simply increase your dosage by 1 tablespoon. This \"reset\" should carry you through to your next deep scoop.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">The Multi-Cat Compounding Effect</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    In households with 3 or more cats, the ammonia load isn't just additive; it's exponential. Because cats tend to use the same \"favorite\" box, that specific area reaches critical saturation within 48 hours. For these high-traffic boxes, we recommend the **Daily Dusting Protocol**: Every morning after your first scoop, sprinkle a single teaspoon over the disturbed litter. This micro-dose keeps the surface active and prevents the smell from ever building up enough to be detectable by guests or your cats.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-6\">Conclusion</h2>\n  <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n    Odor control is math, not magic. By following the **5-Day Rule** (Single Cat) or **3-Day Rule** (Multi-Cat), you stay ahead of the ammonia curve, keeping your home fresh and your cat happy.\n  </p>\n\n  <div class=\"bg-[#FF3131]/10 border border-[#FF3131]/20 rounded-lg p-8 mb-8 text-center\">\n    <h4 class=\"font-bold text-[#FF3131] dark:text-[#FF6B6B] text-2xl mb-4\">\ud83d\udcc5 Get on the Schedule</h4>\n    <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6 text-lg\">\n      Subscribe to Purrify and get your fresh carbon delivered exactly when you need it, based on your household size.\n    </p>\n    <a href=\"/products/subscription\" class=\"inline-block px-8 py-3 bg-[#FF3131] text-white rounded-full font-bold text-lg hover:bg-red-600 transition-all transform hover:scale-105 shadow-xl\">\n      Start My Subscription \u2192\n    </a>\n  </div>\n\n</div>\n</div>",
