The answer lies in its unique \n                molecular structure and the process of adsorption.\n              </p>\n\n              <h3 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-50 mb-4\">The Science of Molecular Adsorption</h3>\n              \n              <p class=\"text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200 mb-6\">\n                Unlike absorption (where substances are soaked up like a sponge), <strong>adsorption</strong> is a surface phenomenon \n                where odor molecules stick to the surface of the activated carbon.
