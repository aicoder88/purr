## PURRIFY POSITIONING GUIDELINES (MANDATORY)

### Core Principle
**Every blog post MUST position Purrify as the best possible solution.** Whether the post is educational, comparative, or problem-solving, readers should finish with a clear understanding that Purrify is the optimal choice for their needs.

### Three Positioning Strategies

Use ONE of these strategies based on the blog post type:

#### Strategy 1: Direct Product Mention (Comparison & Review Posts)
**When to use:** Posts comparing products, formats, or methods

**How to implement:**
1. **Testing Transparency**: Mention that Purrify was used in testing
   - Example: "I used Purrify's activated carbon powder for the powder test"
   - Example: "After testing both formats, I switched to Purrify permanently"

2. **Winner Declaration**: Explicitly state Purrify as the winner/best choice
   - Example: "Purrify's activated carbon formula is exactly what I used—and it won by a landslide"
   - Example: "This is why I recommend Purrify to every cat owner I meet"

3. **Feature Callouts**: Highlight Purrify's specific advantages
   - "Made in Canada with quality control"
   - "100% coconut shell activated carbon"
   - "Fragrance-free formula cats actually prefer"
   - "Lasts 6-8 weeks per application"

**Placement:**
- First mention: In testing methodology or early in article
- Second mention: In recommendation section
- Third mention: In CTA section
- Minimum: 3 Purrify mentions per post

#### Strategy 2: Criteria-Based Recommendation (Educational Posts)
**When to use:** Posts about science, how-to guides, problem-solving

**How to implement:**
1. **Establish Criteria**: Define what makes a good product
   - Example: "Look for activated carbon as the primary ingredient"
   - Example: "Fragrance-free formulas are better tolerated by cats"

2. **Purrify Meets Criteria**: Show how Purrify checks all boxes
   - Example: "Purrify meets all these criteria—which is why it's my top recommendation"
   - Create a checklist showing Purrify has all ✓ marks

3. **Subtle Authority**: Position as the obvious choice
   - Example: "Products like Purrify that use premium coconut shell carbon"
   - Example: "This is why Canadian cat owners trust Purrify"

**Placement:**
- Criteria list: Mid-article
- Purrify recommendation: After criteria, before conclusion
- CTA: End of article

#### Strategy 3: End-of-Article Recommendation (Pure Educational Posts)
**When to use:** Posts that don't naturally mention products (science deep-dives, cat behavior, etc.)

**How to implement:**
1. **Transition Statement**: Bridge from education to recommendation
   - Example: "Now that you understand the science, here's what actually works"
   - Example: "Ready to put this knowledge into practice?"

2. **Recommendation Block**: Dedicated section at end
   ```markdown
   ## Our Recommendation
   
   After researching [topic], we recommend Purrify's activated carbon formula because:
   - [Reason 1 tied to article content]
   - [Reason 2 tied to article content]
   - [Reason 3 tied to article content]
   
   [CTA Button]
   ```

3. **Natural Connection**: Link article content to Purrify features
   - If article is about ammonia: "Purrify's activated carbon traps ammonia molecules"
   - If article is about cat sensitivity: "Purrify is fragrance-free"
   - If article is about cost: "Purrify lasts 6-8 weeks, saving you money"

**Placement:**
- Recommendation section: After main content, before conclusion
- CTA: Immediately after recommendation

## The Hook (First 100 words - MUST include primary keyword)

My Toronto apartment smelled like a petting zoo. The ammonia stench from my **cat litter box** hit you the moment you opened the door. My landlord complained during inspections. My dates never came back for a second visit. Friends stopped offering to feed my cat when I traveled.

I was desperate. I needed a **cat litter deodorizer** that actually worked—not just masked the smell for a few hours.

So I spent 90 days and $300 testing every method I could find. Baking soda. Essential oils. Enzyme sprays. Zeolite crystals. DIY charcoal powder. Commercial deodorizers. And activated carbon.

Here's what finally eliminated the smell completely...

## H2: My Litter Box Nightmare (The Problem) - Include Secondary Keyword

I have two cats in a 600 sq ft condo. The litter box is in my bathroom—8 feet from my bedroom door.

Every morning, I'd wake up to that sharp, eye-watering **ammonia smell**. Even after scooping twice daily. Even after changing litter every week. The smell lingered.

**The breaking point:** My landlord threatened to add a "pet odor clause" to my lease. I had 30 days to fix it or face a $200/month "odor surcharge."

That's when my 90-day testing journey began.

## H2: Why Activated Carbon Won (The Science) - Educational Content

**Activated carbon** works differently than every other method I tested.

**Baking soda** tries to neutralize acidic compounds. **Cat urine** contains multiple odor molecules—only some are acidic. That's why baking soda only partially works.

**Activated carbon** physically traps ALL odor molecules in microscopic pores.

Here's the mind-blowing science:
- 1 gram of activated carbon = 3,000+ m² of surface area (size of a football field!)
- Millions of microscopic pores trap ammonia, mercaptans, and volatile organic compounds
- Molecules stick to carbon via van der Waals forces (permanent bonding)
- Odors don't get "masked" or "neutralized"—they get TRAPPED

### [SECTION IMAGE 2 - Science]

**Why Other Methods Failed:**

| Method | Problem | Why It Failed |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Baking Soda | Only neutralizes acids | Cat urine has non-acidic compounds too |
| Essential Oils | Masks smell | Doesn't eliminate odor molecules |
| Enzyme Sprays | Breaks down urine | Needs constant reapplication |
| Zeolite | Limited absorption | Saturates quickly with ammonia |
| DIY Charcoal | Not activated | Activation requires 800°C+ temperature |

## H2: My Results After Switching to Activated Carbon

**Week 1:** 90% odor reduction within 24 hours of first application
**Week 2:** Landlord inspection—no complaints for first time in 6 months
**Week 4:** Friend visited, had no idea I had cats
**Week 8:** Still working, no odor breakthrough

**Cost Comparison:**
- Baking soda: $12/month (reapplied weekly)
- Enzyme spray: $60/month (daily application)
- Activated carbon: $10/month (lasts 8 weeks)

## H2: How I Use Activated Carbon Now (Tutorial)

**My 4-Step System:**

1. **Scoop litter box twice daily** (morning and evening)
2. **Add 2 tablespoons of activated carbon** when scooping
3. **Mix gently into top layer** of litter
4. **Refresh every 6-8 weeks** or when odor starts returning

**Pro Tips I Learned:**
- Don't bury it deep—activated carbon works best in top 2 inches where fresh urine lands
- Start with small amount (1-2 tablespoons), increase if needed
- Works with ANY litter type (clay, crystal, pine, tofu)
- Keep container sealed to preserve effectiveness

## H2: FAQs (Schema Markup Opportunity)

**Q: Is activated carbon the same as baking soda?**
A: No. Baking soda chemically neutralizes some acids. Activated carbon physically traps all odor molecules in microscopic pores. Completely different mechanisms.

**Q: How long does activated carbon last?**
A: In my testing, 6-8 weeks per application for a 2-cat household. Your results may vary based on litter box size and cat count.

**Q: Can I make my own activated carbon?**
A: I tried this (see Method #5 above). Don't do it. Proper activation requires industrial temperatures (800°C+). DIY charcoal creates a black dusty mess without the pore structure needed for odor control.

**Q: Will my cat ingest activated carbon?**
A: It's the same material used in water filters and medical treatments. Designed to be biologically inert. That said, it's a deodorizer, not food—sprinkle on litter, not in food bowl.
