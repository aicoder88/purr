## Buying Guide: How to Choose the Best Odor-Control Litter

### Consider Your Priorities

**If odor control is your #1 priority:** Choose crystal litters like [Purrify](https://www.purrify.ca/products) or Fresh Step Crystals. They offer superior odor elimination compared to clay or natural litters.

**If you're on a budget:** Dr. Elsey's Ultra or Arm & Hammer Clump & Seal offer the best value for money while still providing good odor control.

**If you want eco-friendly:** World's Best or ökocat are biodegradable and sustainable options.

**If you have multiple cats:** [Purrify](https://www.purrify.ca/) or World's Best Multi-Cat formulas handle heavy use best.

### Litter Type Breakdown

**Crystal Litters (Best for Odor)**
- Pros: Superior odor control, long-lasting, low dust
- Cons: Higher cost, some cats dislike texture
- Best pick: **[Purrify](https://www.purrify.ca/)**

**Clay Litters (Most Popular)**
- Pros: Familiar texture, affordable, widely available

### Multi-Cat Household Tips

If you have multiple cats, odor control becomes even more critical:

3. **Scoop daily** - Even the best litter needs maintenance

## Expert Tips for Maximum Odor Control

### 1. Proper Litter Depth

Use 3-4 inches of litter for optimal odor control. Too little litter (1-2 inches) doesn't absorb effectively.

### 2. Scoop Daily

Even the best odor-control litter needs daily scooping of solid waste. Set a reminder if needed.

### 3. Complete Changes

For clumping litters: Change completely every 2-3 weeks  
For crystal litters: Change when 80% of crystals have changed color (usually 30 days)

### 4. Clean the Box

When doing complete changes, wash the litter box with soap and water, then dry completely before adding fresh litter.

### 5. Box Placement

Place litter boxes in well-ventilated areas. Poor ventilation concentrates odors.

### 6. Use a Litter Mat

Reduces tracking and keeps the area cleaner, which helps with overall odor control.

### 7. Consider an Air Purifier

Pair your litter with a HEPA air purifier near the litter box area for maximum freshness.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the best cat litter for eliminating urine odor?

**[Purrify crystal cat litter](https://www.purrify.ca/)** is the most effective at eliminating urine odor, removing 99% of smell in our testing. The silica gel crystals absorb and trap urine, neutralizing odor-causing bacteria.

### Do scented litters work better for odor control?

No. Scented litters mask odors temporarily but don't eliminate them. Many cats also dislike artificial fragrances. Unscented litters that neutralize odors (like Purrify or Dr. Elsey's) are more effective.

### How often should I change cat litter for best odor control?

- **Crystal litters:** Every 30 days (or when crystals change color)
- **Clumping clay:** Every 2-3 weeks
- **Natural litters:** Every 1-2 weeks

Always scoop solid waste daily regardless of litter type.

### Is crystal litter better than clay for odor?

Yes, in our testing, crystal litters (especially [Purrify](https://www.purrify.ca/products)) significantly outperformed clay litters for odor control. Crystals absorb more moisture and trap odors more effectively than clay.

### Can I mix different cat litters?

It's not recommended for long-term use, but mixing can help transition cats to a new litter. Gradually increase the ratio of new litter over 7-10 days.

### What if my cat won't use the new litter?

Some cats are texture-sensitive. Transition gradually by mixing 25% new litter with 75% old litter, increasing the ratio over 1-2 weeks. If your cat still refuses, try a different type.

### Does baking soda help with cat litter odor?

Baking soda can help neutralize odors when sprinkled on top of litter, but it's not as effective as choosing a high-quality odor-control litter like Purrify. Some cats also dislike the texture of baking soda.
