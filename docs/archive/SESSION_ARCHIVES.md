- Enhanced visibility with white borders and drop shadows
- Proper layering with `z-20` for badges and `z-10` for images

**Dark Mode Enhancements:**
- Card borders: `border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-600`

## Translation Issues Analysis

### Summary

Comprehensive analysis of translation coverage gaps across the Purrify website for English (en), French (fr), and Chinese (zh) locales.

### Critical Issues Found

**1. Hardcoded Text in Components (High Impact)**
- FAQ page - Entirely hardcoded English text
- Testimonials section - Hardcoded fallbacks
- Component headers and labels not using translation keys

**2. HTML Tags Within Translation Strings (Medium-High Impact)**
- Inline HTML tags: `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<b>`, `<span>`
- Complex markup in translatable content
- Dynamic content mixing HTML and text
- Attribute text not consistently translated

**3. Sub-Page Translation Coverage Gaps (High Impact)**
- FAQ page - Completely hardcoded
- Blog pages with mixed content
- Product comparison pages
- Support/contact pages
- Location-specific pages

**4. Dynamic Content Translation Issues (Medium Impact)**
- JavaScript-generated content
- Form validation messages
- Date/time formatting
- Number/currency formatting

**5. SEO and Metadata Translation (High Impact)**
- Meta descriptions not properly translated
- Page titles inconsistent
- Open Graph tags not localized
- Structured data with untranslated content

**6. Image and Media Content (Medium Impact)**
- Alt text not localized
- Image captions hardcoded
- Media-specific copy

### Recommendations

1. Create translation keys for all hardcoded text
2. Extract HTML from translation strings
3. Implement proper i18n for dynamic content
4. Add localization for date/time and currency
5. Translate all metadata and SEO content
6. Localize image alt text and captions

## Dark Mode Detective Report

### Assessment

Initial assessment of dark mode compliance issues in `/pages/dn.tsx`:

**Issues Identified:**
1. Inconsistent dark mode classes - Many text elements lack `dark:` variants
2. Poor contrast ratios - Text like `text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-400` insufficient
3. Missing dark variants - Several elements only have light mode styling
4. Inconsistent background patterns - Mix of different approaches

### Specific Problem Areas

- Line 76: `text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-400` - too low contrast
- Line 114: `text-gray-200 dark:text-gray-300` - needs higher contrast
- Line 126: `text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-400` - insufficient contrast
- Line 139: `text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100` - good pattern
- Line 280-297: Color-coded metrics need better dark variants
- Line 630: `dark:text-green-400` nested incorrectly
- Line 905: `dark:text-blue-200` - good contrast pattern

### Improvements Made

1. **Background System**: Enhanced backdrop-blur with opacity (bg-white/95 dark:bg-gray-800/95)
2. **Typography Hierarchy**: Systematic color mapping for all text sizes
3. **Contrast Fixes**: Eliminated poor contrast issues
4. **Border Enhancement**: Added dark variants to all borders
5. **Color-Coded Elements**: Improved contrast for themed sections

### Validation Results

**Before:** 193 text elements, 87 missing dark variants, 6 poor contrast issues (52% compliance)
