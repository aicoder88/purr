---

## Schema Markup Differentiation

**Blog Posts:** `Article` schema with author, date, comprehensive content
**Learn Pages:** `Article` or `FAQPage` schema with educational focus
**PAA Answers:** `QAPage` schema with direct Q&A format

## Measurement Plan

Track these metrics to verify differentiation is working:

| Metric | PAA Pages | Blog Posts |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Avg. Time on Page | 1-2 minutes | 5-8 minutes |
| Bounce Rate | Lower (got answer, left) | Higher (read long content) |
| Featured Snippets | Target for these | Less likely |
| Conversion Rate | Higher (quick action) | Lower (research mode) |

If PAA pages have 5+ minute avg. time, they need to be shorter.
If blog posts have <3 minute avg. time, they need more depth.

---

## Final Checklist

✅ All conflicting PAA pages rewritten with unique angles
✅ Internal links from PAA to comprehensive content added
✅ Content type badges added to hub page
✅ Schema markup differentiates content types
✅ URL structure signals content depth
✅ Clear user intent targeting for each format

- **PAA:** "Give me the answer fast"

Google can now serve the right content to the right user at the right time.
