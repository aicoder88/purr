# Session 3: Remaining Pages Analysis

## Overview
Reviewed all remaining pages in the site to identify which pages would benefit from images vs. which pages are functional/transactional and don't need lifestyle images.

## Pages That DON'T Need Images (By Design)

### Transactional/Functional Pages ✓
These pages are designed for specific actions and don't benefit from lifestyle imagery:
- `/checkout` - Stripe payment flow
- `/customer/portal` - Account management
- `/customer/referrals` - Referral program dashboard
- `/refer/[code]` - Referral landing (dynamic)
- `/support/contact` - Contact form
- `/support/shipping` - Shipping info table
- `/thank-you` - Order confirmation
- `/free` - Free product claim

### Legal/Policy Pages ✓
Text-heavy legal pages that don't need imagery:
- `/privacy`, `/privacy-policy`
- `/terms`, `/tos`

### Technical Pages ✓
- `/404` - Error page
- `/offline` - PWA offline page
- `/_app`, `/_document`, `/_error` - Next.js system files

### Admin/Testing Pages ✓
- `/admin/referral-analytics` - Admin dashboard
- `/test` - Development testing page
- `/demo/stage5-features` - Internal demo

## Pages That COULD Benefit from Images (Optional Enhancement)

### Product Pages (3 pages)
Currently have product photos but could add lifestyle images:
- `/products/trial-size` - Could add "trying it for first time" images
- `/products/standard` - Could add "single cat household" lifestyle images
- `/products/family-pack` - Could add "multi-cat household" lifestyle images
- `/products/compare` - Comparison table (functional, probably doesn't need images)

### City Landing Pages (7 pages)
SEO-focused pages that could add local appeal:
- `/locations/toronto` - Could add Toronto skyline + cats in apartments
- `/locations/vancouver` - Could add Vancouver scenery + cats
- `/locations/montreal` - Could add Montreal cityscape + cats
- `/locations/calgary` - Could add Calgary skyline + cats
- `/locations/ottawa` - Could add Ottawa landmarks + cats
- `/locations/hamilton` - Could add Hamilton cityscape + cats
- `/locations/quebec-city` - Could add Quebec City + cats

### Marketing Pages
- `/about/our-story` - Could add founder photo, team photos, company milestones
- `/b2b` - B2B sales page could add business/retail imagery
- `/retailers` - Retail partnership page could add store/stockist images
- `/stockists` - Similar to retailers
- `/invest` - Investment page could add business growth imagery
- `/reviews` - Review aggregation page could add customer photos
- `/customers/case-studies` - Could add before/after photos
- `/customers/testimonials` - Could add customer testimonial images

### Comparison Pages

### Priority 2: About/Social Proof Pages
These build trust and connection:

### Priority 3: City Landing Pages (SEO Value)
