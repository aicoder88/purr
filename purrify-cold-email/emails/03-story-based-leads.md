# Story-Based Lead Email Variations (40)

## Variation 1
**Subject:** The pet store owner who couldn't smell her own problem

{{FirstName}},

Marie owns a pet store in Montreal. Three years in business. Great reputation. Loyal customers.

Last summer, a friend visited from Toronto. First words walking in: "Wow, that litter smell is strong."

Marie was shocked. She couldn't smell it anymore. Nose-blind from working there daily.

She asked her staff. They admitted they'd become used to it too. But customers? They noticed every single day.

Marie tried everything: industrial fans, air purifiers, scented products. Nothing worked.

Then she discovered Purrify. Started displaying it prominently. Used it in the demo area.

Within a month, customers started commenting: "Your store smells so much fresher!"

The product sold itself. Customers who bought it came back for more. 40-60% margins didn't hurt either.

Today, Marie stocks up heavily. It's her answer to a problem she didn't even know she had.

Would you like to solve a problem your customers notice but you might not?

## Variation 2
**Subject:** The customer who almost rehomed her cats

Hi {{FirstName}},

Last year, a woman walked into a Montreal pet store crying.

She had four cats. Lived in a one-bedroom apartment. The ammonia smell was unbearable.

Her landlord had issued a warning. Her boyfriend was threatening to leave. She was seriously considering rehoming three of her cats.

"I've tried everything," she told the store owner. "Nothing works."

The owner handed her Purrify. "One more thing to try."

Three days later, she came back. Bought six more bottles. Told everyone in the store: "My apartment doesn't smell anymore. I can keep my cats."

She's now a regular customer. Buys Purrify every month. Brings in other cat-owner friends.

That store owner told me: "Purrify doesn't just sell - it saves relationships, keeps families together, solves real problems."

One day she visited a Montreal pet store looking for food. Saw Purrify. Skeptical but desperate.

Bought one bottle. Used it that night.

Next morning, she called the store: "What IS this stuff? I need more. Like, a LOT more."

Now she buys 12 bottles monthly. Told every foster in her network.

Hi {{FirstName}},

Jacques runs a pet store in Montreal. Skeptical guy. Didn't think Purrify would be special.

First customer: "Whoa. The smell is gone. I'll take two bottles."

Second customer watched the demo. Bought three bottles before the 20 minutes was even up.

By end of day, Jacques had sold 67 bottles. $2,000+ revenue. Single day.

He called me laughing: "I've never seen anything sell itself like that."

{{FirstName}},

Dr. Chen is a veterinarian in Montreal. She doesn't usually recommend specific stores.

But last year, she had a problem patient. Cat with litter box aversion. Owner at wit's end.

Standard solutions weren't working. Dr. Chen suspected the ammonia smell was deterring the cat.

She'd heard about Purrify from another client. Sent the owner to the pet store that carried it.

Two weeks later: Problem solved. Cat using the box normally. Owner ecstatic.

Now Dr. Chen recommends that pet store specifically: "They carry Purrify. Ask for it."

The store owner estimates 3-5 vet referrals weekly now. All high-intent customers who buy immediately.

**Subject:** The landlord who called to say thank you

Hi {{FirstName}},

Weird thing happened to a Montreal pet store owner.

A landlord called the store. Said: "I need to thank you."

Confused, the owner asked why.

"One of my tenants came to your store. You sold her something for cat smell. Her apartment doesn't reek anymore. I don't have to have that conversation now."

The product? Purrify.

The tenant had been one complaint away from eviction. The landlord was dreading enforcing it.

That one bottle solved a potential legal situation.

The landlord now recommends that pet store to all his tenants with cats. Sends them there specifically.

The owner said: "I never thought about landlords as a referral source. Now I market to property managers."

Within hours: 200+ people trying to access the store's website. Phone ringing nonstop. Line out the door by noon.

They sold out of Purrify in one day. Had to emergency reorder.

Him, skeptically: "Fine. Last try. Then the cats go."

One week later, they came back. Both smiling. Bought six bottles.

Her: "Our house doesn't smell. We're not fighting about it anymore. Thank you."

That staff member told me: "I think I saved a relationship that day."

Then he started carrying Purrify. Put it everywhere in the store.

The smell diminished noticeably. Staff stopped complaining.

His newest employee actually said: "This is the first pet store I've worked at that doesn't stink."

She was crying in the store aisle.

Staff gave her Purrify. "Try this first."

Three days later, she called the store. Also crying, but differently.

"It works. It actually works. I don't have to... I can keep Sophie."

Bought four bottles. Told her friend who was with her.

Friend bought three.

The store owner said: "One customer became a sales force for us."

Hi {{FirstName}},

Montreal store had a customer who returned products constantly.

Every "odor control" product on the shelf. She'd tried them all. Returned them all.

Finally, someone handed her Purrify. "Last one to try."

She bought it skeptically.

Week went by. Two weeks. No return.

Month later, she came back. Staff thought: "Here we go again."

Instead: "I need five more bottles. And I'm sorry for all the returns. This one actually works."

Property manager in Montreal oversees 40 rental units.

Constant problem: Cat owner tenants creating odor complaints.

Tired of mediating disputes. Considering breed/species restrictions.

Heard about Purrify from a tenant. Skeptical but curious.

Bought samples from a local store. Distributed to problem units.

Complaints stopped within two weeks.

Now he bulk orders monthly. Includes it in move-in kits for cat owners.

Told the store owner: "This solved a legal headache for me."

That store now supplies three property management companies.

At 40-60% margins on bulk B2B orders, commercial accounts are extremely profitable.

Should we pursue property managers in {{City}}?

Cheers,

**Subject:** The Christmas gift winner

{{FirstName}},

Extended family gift exchange. Everyone brings one gift.

Someone brought a bottle of Purrify from a Montreal pet store.

Initially seen as a joke gift. Laughter in the room.

The recipient (cat owner) tried it politely.

Next family gathering: "That joke gift was the best present I got. Seriously."

Five family members asked where to buy it. All visited that store.

The original gift-giver told the store owner: "I was just being practical. Didn't realize I'd start a trend."

The store now markets Purrify specifically for holiday gifts.

At 40-60% margins, gift season creates concentrated sales spikes.

## Variation 38
**Subject:** The divorce settlement

Hi {{FirstName}},

Difficult story, but real.

Couple divorcing in Montreal. Fighting over custody of their two cats.

Part of the dispute: Each accused the other of inadequate care.

Evidence? House smell.

Each bought Purrify from a local store (separately, didn't know the other was buying it).

Used it in their respective homes.

During custody evaluation, both homes passed odor assessments.

Mediator: "Neither home has odor issues. You can both provide adequate care."

They settled. Split custody amicably.

Both called the store separately to thank them.

Store owner told me: "I never imagined our product would be used in legal situations."

At 40-60% margins, sometimes you're solving problems you never anticipated.

## Variation 40
**Subject:** The full circle moment

{{FirstName}},

Three years ago, a woman walked into a Montreal pet store. Desperate about cat smell.

Bought Purrify. It worked. Became a regular customer.

Last month, she came in with a young couple.

"This is my son and his fiancée. They just adopted their first cat. I told them to come here and buy this."

She handed them a bottle of Purrify.

"Start with it from day one. You'll never have smell problems."

The couple bought six bottles based on her recommendation.

The store owner recognized her. Pulled her aside:

"You were one of our first Purrify customers. Now you're sending us the next generation."

She smiled: "You solved my problem. Now I solve other people's problems."

At 40-60% margins, customer lifetime value includes the customers they bring.
