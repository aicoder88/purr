Subject: Story idea for {{StoreName}} readers on litter box odor control

Hi {{FirstName}},

I am reaching out with a data-backed consumer story idea for {{StoreName}}.

Our team at Purrify studies litter box odor control in real households, and we have clear findings on what works long-term:
- activated carbon adsorption versus fragrance masking
- practical routines for multi-cat homes and apartments
- before/after outcomes that readers can apply immediately

If useful, I can send:
1. A concise media brief with key data points
2. An expert quote package
3. Supporting visuals

If someone else handles features or home/pet coverage, could you point me to the right contact?

Thanks,
{{FirstName}} {{LastName}}
