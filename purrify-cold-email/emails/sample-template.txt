Subject: {{FirstName}}, quick question about {{StoreName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

How often do customers at {{StoreName}} ask if you have something that actually WORKS for litter box smell?

I'm guessing weekly, if not daily.

Here's the challenge: Most products on your shelf don't actually eliminate odor - they just mask it or reduce it slightly.

Purrify is different. It's an activated coconut carbon additive that eliminates ammonia at the molecular level. No perfume. No harsh chemicals. Just actual odor elimination.

20+ pet stores in Montreal have made it a top-seller because:
- It actually works (customers come back for more)
- 40-60% profit margins
- Repeat purchases every 4-6 weeks
- Near-zero returns

We've helped stores transform their most frustrated customers into their most loyal ones.

Would 10 minutes on a call be worth exploring how this could work for {{StoreName}} in {{City}}?

Best,
