# Problem-Agitation-Solution Email Variations (40)

## Variation 1
**Subject:** Is litter box odor killing your pet store's reputation?

Hi {{FirstName}},

I'll get straight to it - nothing drives customers out faster than walking into a pet store that smells like a litter box.

Even worse? When they associate that smell with YOUR brand instead of just "pet stores in general."

The problem is traditional solutions (scented litters, air fresheners) just mask the smell. Your store still has that underlying ammonia punch that makes shoppers rush through their visit.

That's where Purrify comes in. It's an activated coconut carbon additive that actually eliminates odors at the molecular level - not just covers them up.

Over 20 stores in Montreal are already using it, and they're seeing customers linger 30% longer in-store. One owner told me it's the first time in 8 years her store doesn't smell "pet-ish."

Best part? 40-60% markup potential for you. Your customers get a solution that actually works, you get healthy margins.

## Variation 2
**Subject:** The hidden reason customers rush through your store

{{FirstName}},

Quick question: How long do customers typically spend browsing in {{StoreName}}?

If it's less than 10 minutes, odor might be the silent culprit.

Here's the thing - people won't tell you your store smells. They'll just spend less time (and less money) there.

The ammonia from litter displays and the general "pet store smell" creates subconscious discomfort. Even cat owners don't want to smell litter boxes while shopping.

Traditional solutions fail because:
- Scented litters ADD competing smells
- Air fresheners create that artificial "trying to hide something" smell
- Frequent cleaning is expensive and time-consuming

Purrify takes a different approach. It's an odor-eliminating additive that uses activated coconut carbon to neutralize ammonia at the source.

20+ Montreal pet stores now carry it, and the feedback has been incredible. Customers actually thank them for having a "fresh-smelling store."

Plus, at 40-60% margins, it's one of your more profitable SKUs.

Would you be open to a 5-minute call about bringing it to {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 3
**Subject:** Why your best customers shop at big box stores

Hi {{FirstName}},

Brutal truth: Your most loyal cat owners are buying litter at Costco and PetSmart.

Not because of price (though that's what they'll say).

It's because those stores have industrial ventilation systems that mask the litter box smell. Your store? Not so much.

And every time they walk past that ammonia punch, they think "I'll just grab it at Costco next time."

The frustrating part? You can't fix this with ventilation. It's too expensive.

But you CAN fix it with what you sell.

Purrify is a litter additive that eliminates odor at the molecular level. When your customers use it at home, their houses don't smell like litter boxes. When you display it in-store, your STORE doesn't smell like a litter box.

We've got 20+ stores in Montreal that have made it a cornerstone product. They're seeing:
- Reduced customer churn
- Longer browse times
- 40-60% profit margins on every unit

Worth a conversation about {{StoreName}}?

## Variation 4
**Subject:** Your store's smell problem (and how to profit from it)

{{FirstName}},

Every pet store owner knows THE smell.

That ammonia-heavy, vaguely unpleasant odor that hits you the moment someone opens a bag of litter or walks past the litter aisle.

You've tried everything:
- Better ventilation (expensive)
- Scented litters (customers complain)
- Constant cleaning (labor intensive)
- Air fresheners (just masks it)

None of it really works.

Here's the counterintuitive solution: Sell your way out of the problem.

Purrify is an activated carbon additive that eliminates litter box odor at the source. When your customers use it, their homes stay fresh. When you display it prominently, it actually helps neutralize your in-store odor too.

The Montreal pet store community has embraced it (20+ locations). They're solving THEIR smell problem while adding a high-margin (40-60%) product that customers genuinely need.

One owner put it perfectly: "I'm making money solving my own problem."

Interested in doing the same for {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 5
**Subject:** The product your customers are already looking for

Hi {{FirstName}},

How often do customers ask you: "Do you have anything that actually WORKS for litter box smell?"

I'm guessing weekly, if not daily.

And you probably point them to scented litters or baking soda products that... sort of work. But not really.

The problem isn't that solutions don't exist. It's that most of them don't actually eliminate odor - they just mask it or reduce it slightly.

Your customers are frustrated. They've tried everything. Some are even considering getting rid of their cats (seriously).

Purrify is the solution they've been searching for. Activated coconut carbon that bonds with ammonia molecules and eliminates them completely.

No perfume. No harsh chemicals. Just actual odor elimination.

20+ pet stores in Montreal have made it a top-seller. Customers come back specifically for it, often buying multiple bottles.

At 40-60% margins, it's profitable. But more importantly, it's the answer to that question you get asked all the time.

## Variation 6
**Subject:** Stop losing customers to Amazon

{{FirstName}},

Your cat-owning customers love shopping local. They want to support {{StoreName}}.

But they're tired of litter box odor solutions that don't work.

So they go to Amazon, read 2000 reviews, and find... the same ineffective products you carry.

Here's your opportunity: Carry something Amazon doesn't have (yet).

Purrify is a premium odor eliminator that's currently sold primarily through independent pet stores. We're not on Amazon. We're not in big box chains.

This gives stores like yours a competitive advantage - an exclusive solution to one of cat owners' biggest pain points.

The product works incredibly well (activated coconut carbon technology), customers love it, and your margins are 40-60%.

20+ Montreal stores are already using this as a differentiator against online retailers.

Would you like to join them?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 7
**Subject:** The complaint you hear but can't solve

Hi {{FirstName}},

"I've tried everything for the litter box smell. Nothing works."

You hear this all the time. And honestly, what can you say?

Most products on your shelf are variations of the same thing:
- Scented litters (add smell instead of removing it)
- Baking soda products (marginally effective)
- Enzymatic sprays (expensive, inconsistent)

None of them actually eliminate ammonia - they just reduce it or cover it up.

Your customers are desperate for a real solution. When they don't find it at {{StoreName}}, they assume it doesn't exist.

But it does.

Purrify uses activated coconut carbon to bond with and eliminate ammonia molecules. It's not a cover-up - it's actual elimination.

We've proven it works in 20+ Montreal pet stores. Customers who've "tried everything" finally find relief. They become loyal repeat buyers.

And at 40-60% margins, it's worth your shelf space.

Want to finally solve this complaint for your customers?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 8
**Subject:** Multi-cat households are your untapped goldmine

{{FirstName}},

Here's a profitable insight: Multi-cat households spend 3-4x more than single-cat households.

But they're also the MOST frustrated customers.

Two cats? Manageable odor. Three cats? Constant smell. Four or more? They've basically given up on having guests over.

These customers are desperate for solutions. They'll try anything. They'll pay premium prices.

The problem? Nothing on your shelf actually works for multi-cat intensity.

Purrify is specifically effective for multi-cat households. The activated carbon technology scales - more cats means more ammonia, but Purrify handles it.

We've seen Montreal stores build an entire customer base of multi-cat owners who swear by it. They're your most loyal customers because you finally solved their biggest problem.

At 40-60% margins and high repeat purchase rates, this segment is incredibly profitable.

Should we talk about capturing this market in {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 9
**Subject:** Your employees are tired of the smell too

Hi {{FirstName}},

Real talk: Your staff complains about the smell.

Maybe not to you directly. But they mention it to each other. They dread restocking the litter aisle. They apologize to customers about it.

It affects morale. It affects how they talk about working at {{StoreName}}.

And if THEY notice it (after being nose-blind from working there), imagine how strong it is for customers walking in fresh.

You can't fix this with ventilation. You've tried air fresheners. You've tried everything.

Except... solving it at the source.

Purrify eliminates ammonia odor at the molecular level. When you carry it (and maybe even use it in your display area), the smell problem diminishes significantly.

20+ Montreal pet store owners have told us this was an unexpected benefit - their staff actually thanked them.

Plus, at 40-60% margins, it pays for itself quickly.

Want to improve your store environment while increasing profits?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Variation 10
**Subject:** The truth about "natural" deodorizers

{{FirstName}},

Your customers ask for "natural" litter box solutions all the time.

You probably point them to baking soda products or plant-based litters.

And then they come back a week later saying it didn't work.

Here's why: Most "natural" deodorizers don't actually eliminate ammonia. They're not chemically capable of it.

Baking soda? Absorbs some odor but saturates quickly.
Plant-based litters? Better than clay, but still don't eliminate the ammonia molecule.

Purrify is different. It's genuinely natural (activated coconut carbon) AND actually works.

The carbon bonds with ammonia molecules and eliminates them completely. It's not a mask or a neutralizer - it's true elimination.

Cat owners who want natural AND effective finally have an option.

20+ Montreal stores have made this their go-to recommendation for the "natural products" crowd. These customers become incredibly loyal because you finally gave them something that works.

At 40-60% margins, it's profitable too.

Should we discuss bringing this to {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 11
**Subject:** Why your cat litter sales are stagnant

Hi {{FirstName}},

Most pet stores see flat litter sales year over year.

Makes sense, right? People need what they need. Market's mature.

But here's what's actually happening: Your customers are buying LESS litter from you because they hate dealing with it.

The smell is so unpleasant that they:
- Put off changing the litter
- Buy the minimum amount
- Avoid shopping that aisle
- Switch to online ordering so they don't have to carry it

When you solve the odor problem, behavior changes:
- Customers change litter more frequently (more sales)
- They buy in bulk (larger transactions)
- They shop the litter aisle without hesitation
- They buy in-store instead of online

Purrify has helped 20+ Montreal stores grow their litter category by 15-25%. Not through discounting - through solving the core problem.

At 40-60% margins, it's also more profitable per unit than most litters.

Want to revive your litter category?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Variation 12
**Subject:** Apartment dwellers need this

{{FirstName}},

Quick question: What percentage of your customers live in apartments or condos?

In most cities, it's 40-60%. And these customers are DESPERATE for litter odor solutions.

Why? Because that smell doesn't dissipate. It concentrates. It lingers. Landlords complain. Neighbors notice.

These customers have tried everything because they have to. Their living situation depends on it.

Purrify is specifically effective in small spaces where odor concentration is highest. The activated carbon technology works faster and more completely than anything else on the market.

Montreal stores near high-density residential areas have seen huge adoption. Apartment dwellers become repeat customers within weeks.

At 40-60% margins and high repeat rates, this is a profitable demographic to serve.

Should we explore how this could work for {{StoreName}} in {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 13
**Subject:** First-time cat owners are confused

Hi {{FirstName}},

First-time cat owners are some of your best customers - excited, willing to spend, asking lots of questions.

But they're also shocked by how much litter boxes smell.

They thought it would be manageable. It's not.

They come to you looking for solutions. You sell them scented litter or baking soda products. They try them. The smell continues.

Many of them feel misled - "Why didn't anyone warn me about this?"

Some even rehome their cats because they can't handle the odor.

Purrify gives you something to recommend that actually works. You can confidently tell first-time owners: "This will eliminate the smell."

And it does.

20+ Montreal stores now include Purrify in their "new cat owner starter kit" recommendations. It prevents disappointment, builds trust, and creates loyal customers.

At 40-60% margins, it's a profitable solution to a real problem.

Want to improve your new customer experience?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 14
**Subject:** Senior cat owners will pay premium prices

{{FirstName}},

Here's something you've probably noticed: Senior cat urine smells MUCH stronger than younger cat urine.

Kidney function declines. Ammonia concentration increases. The smell becomes almost unbearable.

Owners of senior cats (typically 10+ years old) are dealing with:
- Stronger baseline odor
- More frequent urination
- Potential litter box aversion issues
- Emotional attachment to their aging pet

These owners will pay ANYTHING that works. Price is not a concern - effectiveness is.

Standard deodorizers don't cut it anymore. They need something stronger.

Purrify's activated carbon technology handles high-ammonia urine better than anything else. It's specifically effective for the senior cat situation.

Montreal stores have found this demographic becomes fiercely loyal. They'll drive across town specifically for Purrify.

At 40-60% margins and customers willing to pay premium prices, this is a high-value segment.

Worth discussing for {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 15
**Subject:** The summer odor crisis is coming

Hi {{FirstName}},

Every summer, the same thing happens:

Customers flood in asking for litter odor solutions. The heat amplifies ammonia smell. Houses become unbearable.

You see a spike in returns. People try products that don't work. They get frustrated.

Your staff fields complaint after complaint.

What if instead of a crisis, summer became your highest-margin season?

Purrify sales spike during hot months because it actually solves the heat-amplified odor problem. Montreal stores stock up before summer and watch it fly off shelves.

At 40-60% margins, this seasonal demand is highly profitable.

Plus, customers you acquire during summer "crisis mode" become year-round repeat buyers.

We're a few months out from peak season. Should we talk about stocking {{StoreName}} before the rush?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 16
**Subject:** Stop refunding frustrated customers

{{FirstName}},

How many litter-related returns do you process monthly?

Customer buys "odor control" litter. Doesn't work. Returns it.

Buys a different brand. Still doesn't work. Returns that too.

Eventually they just give up - on your store or on solving the problem.

Every return costs you:
- The product cost
- Staff time processing it
- Customer disappointment
- Reduced trust in your recommendations

The root issue? Most odor control products don't actually control odor.

Purrify is different. It works so consistently that Montreal stores report almost zero returns. When customers try it, they keep buying it.

At 40-60% margins with virtually no returns, it's one of your most profitable products.

Plus, successful purchases build trust - customers believe your future recommendations.

Want to reduce returns while increasing profit?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 17
**Subject:** Your Google reviews mention "smell"

Hi {{FirstName}},

I was researching pet stores in {{City}} and read through {{StoreName}}'s Google reviews.

Great overall rating, but I noticed multiple reviews mention the store smell.

Even positive reviews often include phrases like:
- "Great store, typical pet store smell though"
- "Love shopping here but the litter aisle is rough"
- "Amazing selection, wish they had better ventilation"

Customers notice. And they mention it publicly.

The challenge? You can't ventilate your way out of this without major construction.

But you CAN solve it with product strategy.

Purrify eliminates ammonia odor at the source. When you carry it (and display it prominently), it actually helps neutralize your in-store odor.

Montreal stores that implemented this saw their "smell" review mentions drop significantly within 3-4 months.

Plus, at 40-60% margins, it's profitable while improving your reputation.

Worth a conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 18
**Subject:** Cat owners are embarrassed

{{FirstName}},

Here's something customers won't tell you:

They're embarrassed about how their house smells.

They know it smells like litter box. They know guests notice. They feel judged.

When they come into {{StoreName}}, they're not just buying products - they're looking for hope.

They want to believe a solution exists. They want you to tell them "this will work."

But most products disappoint. So they stop believing.

Purrify gives you credibility. It actually works, so when you recommend it, customers get results.

Suddenly you're not just "the pet store" - you're "the place that solved my embarrassing problem."

20+ Montreal stores have built incredible customer loyalty this way. People tell their cat-owner friends. Word spreads.

At 40-60% margins, it's profitable. But the real value is the trust and loyalty you build.

Should we discuss bringing this to {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 19
**Subject:** Health-conscious customers need this

Hi {{FirstName}},

More and more pet owners are thinking about household air quality.

They're concerned about:
- Ammonia exposure (especially with kids in the house)
- Chemical fragrances in scented litters
- Respiratory health for their pets
- Long-term indoor air quality

These customers are willing to pay premium prices for genuinely clean air.

The problem? Most "solutions" just trade one problem for another:
- Scented litters add VOCs
- Air fresheners introduce chemicals
- Masks don't eliminate the underlying ammonia

Purrify actually removes ammonia from the air. No fragrances, no harsh chemicals - just activated coconut carbon doing what it does naturally.

Health-conscious customers LOVE this. They feel good about the purchase. They tell other health-conscious friends.

Montreal stores report this demographic has the highest lifetime value - they buy regularly and rarely price shop.

At 40-60% margins, it's a profitable way to serve this growing market segment.

[Your Name]

## Variation 20
**Subject:** Your competition doesn't have this (yet)

{{FirstName}},

Quick competitive analysis of pet stores in {{City}}:

I checked the websites and called around. None of them carry Purrify.

This means {{StoreName}} could be the ONLY place in {{City}} where cat owners can find a solution that actually eliminates litter box odor.

That's a differentiator. That's a reason to choose you over competition.

"The store that carries that amazing odor eliminator" is better branding than "another pet store."

20+ Montreal stores are using this as a competitive advantage. They advertise it. Customers seek them out specifically.

At 40-60% margins, it's profitable.

But more importantly, it gives you something your competition doesn't have.

Interested in being first to market in {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 21
**Subject:** Subscription customers are the most profitable

Hi {{FirstName}},

The holy grail of retail: Predictable recurring revenue.

Most pet products don't lend themselves to subscriptions. Purchase frequency varies. Customers shop around.

But odor eliminators? Used daily. Depleted consistently. Repurchased like clockwork.

Purrify customers typically repurchase every 4-6 weeks. Same product, same quantity, same timing.

Some Montreal stores have set up informal "standing orders" for regular customers. They call when it's time. Customer comes in, buys, leaves. Easy revenue.

At 40-60% margins with predictable repurchase rates, this creates reliable profit streams.

Plus, these repeat visits often lead to additional impulse purchases.

Should we discuss building a subscription-like customer base at {{StoreName}}?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 22
**Subject:** Cat cafes and shelters need this

{{FirstName}},

Beyond retail customers, there's another market: Commercial cat facilities.

- Cat cafes
- Animal shelters
- Boarding facilities
- Grooming salons

These businesses NEED odor control. Their reputation depends on it. They'll pay commercial prices.

Purrify works exceptionally well in high-density cat environments. Several Montreal shelters and cafes have become bulk buyers.

Here's the opportunity for {{StoreName}}:

These facilities need a reliable local supplier. If you stock Purrify, they'll buy from you regularly. Larger quantities. Consistent orders.

At 40-60% margins on bulk purchases, it's extremely profitable.

Plus, when facility staff see it work commercially, they buy it for their personal cats too.

Want to explore the commercial market in {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 23
**Subject:** Product demonstrations sell themselves

Hi {{FirstName}},

Here's the easiest sales pitch you'll ever make:

Open a container of used litter. Let it smell terrible. Add Purrify. Wait 30 minutes. Smell again.

The odor is GONE.

Customers who see this demonstration buy immediately. No sales pitch needed. The product proves itself.

Montreal stores do weekend demos. They set up a small station. Let customers smell the before/after.

Conversion rate on demos? Nearly 100%.

At 40-60% margins, even a simple demo day becomes incredibly profitable.

Plus, customers who see it work become evangelists. They tell their cat-owner friends.

Would {{StoreName}} be interested in doing a demo day? We can provide materials and guidance.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 24
**Subject:** Winter makes litter odor worse

{{FirstName}},

You've probably noticed: Litter box smell gets worse in winter.

Why? Closed windows. Less ventilation. Dry air concentrates ammonia.

Your customers notice too. Winter is when they desperately search for solutions.

Most stores don't prepare for this seasonal spike. They're caught off guard by increased demand for odor solutions.

Smart stores (like the 20+ in Montreal) stock up on Purrify before winter hits.

They experience:
- Higher sales during typically slower winter months
- Grateful customers who finally found relief
- Repeat purchases throughout the season
- 40-60% margins during profitable winter peaks

We're heading into colder months. Should we discuss stocking {{StoreName}} before the seasonal surge?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 25
**Subject:** Vet clinics recommend it

Hi {{FirstName}},

Word-of-mouth from veterinarians is the best marketing you can't buy.

Several Montreal vet clinics now recommend Purrify to clients dealing with litter box odor issues.

Why? Because it works. Vets see clients struggling with:
- Litter box aversion (cat won't use the box)
- Household conflicts over smell
- Considering rehoming due to odor

Purrify solves these problems. When vets recommend it and clients get results, they trust that vet more.

Here's the opportunity: Vets recommend it, but they don't sell it. They tell clients "go to {{StoreName}} - they carry it."

This creates foot traffic. Vet-referred customers who specifically request Purrify.

At 40-60% margins, this veterinary referral channel is highly profitable.

Should we talk about positioning {{StoreName}} as the local source for vet-recommended products?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 26
**Subject:** Influencer culture works for pet products

{{FirstName}},

Pet influencers are huge. Cat accounts on Instagram have millions of followers.

When a local cat influencer discovers Purrify at {{StoreName}}, they post about it.

Their followers in {{City}} see it. They come to your store looking for it.

This has happened organically in Montreal. Cat influencers found it, loved it, posted about it.

Stores experienced spikes in young customers specifically requesting "that product from Instagram."

At 40-60% margins, influencer-driven traffic is incredibly profitable.

The best part? You don't have to do any marketing. Just stock it. Customers who love it will share it.

Want to tap into social media-driven sales at {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 27
**Subject:** Small stores compete on solutions, not price

Hi {{FirstName}},

You can't compete with Chewy on price. You can't compete with PetSmart on selection.

But you CAN compete on solutions.

Big box stores and online retailers carry commodity products. Same stuff everywhere.

When you carry Purrify, you're carrying a SOLUTION - something that actually solves a major pain point.

Customers will pay more and drive farther for solutions than for commodities.

Montreal stores have used this to defend against big box competition. They're "the store with that amazing odor eliminator" rather than "just another pet store."

At 40-60% margins, solution-based products are more profitable than commodity price wars.

Want to differentiate {{StoreName}} from big box competitors?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 28
**Subject:** Foster families need help

{{FirstName}},

Cat foster families are heroes. They take in cats temporarily, provide care, facilitate adoptions.

They're also overwhelmed by litter box odor.

Foster families typically have 3-10 cats at a time. The ammonia buildup is intense.

These families are connected to your local rescue community. They talk to each other. They recommend products.

When one foster family finds Purrify at {{StoreName}}, they tell the entire foster network.

Suddenly you have 10-15 new customers buying regularly at 40-60% margins.

Montreal stores have built strong relationships with the rescue/foster community through Purrify.

Should we discuss connecting {{StoreName}} with {{City}}'s rescue community?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 29
**Subject:** Customer lifetime value matters more than first sale

Hi {{FirstName}},

Most products are one-time or occasional purchases.

Cat owners might buy a bed once every few years. Toys occasionally. Even litter can be unpredictable.

But odor eliminators used consistently become habitual purchases.

Purrify customers repurchase every 4-6 weeks for the life of their cat (average: 12-15 years).

At $20-30 per bottle, that's $2,600-5,850 lifetime revenue per customer.

At 40-60% margins, that's $1,040-3,510 lifetime profit per customer.

Montreal stores have found that acquiring ONE Purrify customer is worth more than selling dozens of commodity items.

This shifts how you think about customer acquisition and retention.

Should we discuss building high-lifetime-value customers at {{StoreName}}?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Variation 30
**Subject:** Your nose is lying to you

{{FirstName}},

You work in {{StoreName}} every day.

You've become nose-blind to the smell.

Your staff has too.

But customers notice. Every single customer walking in notices.

Some mention it politely. Most don't say anything. They just spend less time browsing.

The challenge? You can't smell the problem anymore, so you don't realize how bad it is.

Ask a friend who doesn't work in pet retail to visit your store. Get honest feedback.

Then solve it.

Purrify eliminates ammonia odor at the source. When you display it prominently (and maybe use it in your litter demo area), the smell diminishes noticeably.

20+ Montreal stores have done this. The feedback from customers has been striking.

At 40-60% margins, it's profitable while solving a problem you might not even realize you have.

Want an outside perspective on {{StoreName}}'s environment?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 31
**Subject:** Gift buyers need guidance

Hi {{FirstName}},

Holidays and birthdays bring gift buyers - people who don't own cats but are buying for cat owners.

They ask: "What do cat people actually need?"

Most staff recommend toys or treats. Safe choices.

But here's what cat owners actually want: Solutions to their daily frustrations.

Litter box odor is the #1 daily frustration.

When you recommend Purrify to gift buyers, they love it:
- It's practical
- It's something the recipient genuinely needs
- It's a premium product (looks like a thoughtful gift)
- It actually works (they look like a hero)

Montreal stores have found gift sales of Purrify have surprisingly high adoption during holidays.

At 40-60% margins, gift sales are profitable. Plus, the recipient often becomes a repeat customer.

Should we prepare {{StoreName}} for gift season?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 32
**Subject:** Environmental customers pay premium

{{FirstName}},

Eco-conscious consumers are one of your highest-value segments.

They research products. They care about ingredients. They pay premium prices for sustainable options.

Purrify appeals strongly to this demographic:
- Made from coconut carbon (renewable resource)
- No harsh chemicals
- Biodegradable
- Reduces litter waste (cats use boxes more willingly when they don't smell)

Montreal stores have found eco-conscious customers become brand advocates. They write reviews, tell friends, post on social media.

At 40-60% margins, this demographic is profitable.

Plus, their word-of-mouth brings more customers just like them.

Want to capture environmentally-conscious pet owners in {{City}}?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## Variation 33
**Subject:** Your most profitable square foot of shelf space

Hi {{FirstName}},

Retail is about profit per square foot.

Most litter products are low margin, bulky, and slow-moving.

Purrify is the opposite:
- 40-60% margins (higher than almost anything else)
- Compact (high density per square foot)
- Fast-moving (repeat purchases every 4-6 weeks)

Montreal stores have found it's consistently their most profitable shelf space.

One owner calculated it: Same square footage generates 3-4x more profit with Purrify than with traditional litter products.

When you're looking to optimize your store layout, profit density matters.

Should we discuss maximizing {{StoreName}}'s profitability per square foot?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 34
**Subject:** Customers are searching for this online

{{FirstName}},

Curious about demand in {{City}}?

Google Trends shows consistent search volume for:
- "cat litter odor eliminator {{City}}"
- "litter box smell solution {{City}}"
- "activated carbon cat litter {{City}}"

Your potential customers are actively searching for this solution.

But if you don't carry it, they'll:
1. Buy generic products on Amazon (not great, so they'll be disappointed)
2. Keep searching (and eventually find Purrify somewhere else)
3. Give up (and continue being frustrated)

When you stock Purrify, you capture that search demand.

Montreal stores optimized their Google Business profiles to mention Purrify. They're seeing increased foot traffic from local searches.

At 40-60% margins, capturing online search intent is highly profitable.

Want to capture the customers already searching for this in {{City}}?

Cheers,

## Variation 35
**Subject:** Staff training sells more

Hi {{FirstName}},

Your staff can sell Purrify without being pushy.

The script is simple:

Customer: "Do you have anything for litter box smell?"
Staff: "Yes! Purrify is incredible. Uses activated carbon to actually eliminate ammonia. Customers swear by it."

That's it. No hard sell needed.

Because it works, customers come back thanking your staff. This reinforces their confidence in recommending it.

Montreal stores report staff enthusiasm for Purrify is higher than for almost any other product.

Why? Because they see direct positive feedback from customers who get results.

At 40-60% margins, even modest staff recommendations drive significant profit.

Should we set up a staff training call for {{StoreName}}?

Best,

## Variation 36
**Subject:** Bundle strategies increase transaction size

{{FirstName}},

Average transaction value is critical to profitability.

Smart bundling can increase it significantly.

Montreal stores have found these bundles work well:
- "New Cat Owner Kit" (litter + scoop + Purrify)
- "Multi-Cat Solution" (large litter + 2 bottles of Purrify)
- "Ultimate Fresh Kit" (premium litter + Purrify + mat)

When customers buy bundles, transaction values increase 40-60%.

Plus, when Purrify is included in the bundle, customers experience results and come back specifically for it.

At 40-60% margins on Purrify, bundling is extremely profitable.

Should we discuss bundle strategies for {{StoreName}}?

Cheers,

## Variation 37
**Subject:** Solve problems before they happen

Hi {{FirstName}},

Best time to solve litter odor? BEFORE it becomes a problem.

When customers buy their first cat (or kitten), include Purrify in your recommendations.

"Use this from day one and you'll never have odor issues."

Prevention is easier than treatment. New cat owners who start with Purrify never experience the "I've tried everything" frustration.

They become loyal customers because your advice worked perfectly.

Montreal stores include Purrify in their "new cat consultation." These customers have the highest lifetime value.

At 40-60% margins with long-term loyalty, this is smart business.

Should we discuss positioning Purrify as preventive care at {{StoreName}}?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Variation 38
**Subject:** Reviews drive online traffic to stores

{{FirstName}},

When customers love Purrify, they leave glowing reviews on {{StoreName}}'s Google listing.

These reviews mention:
- Specific product they found
- Helpful staff recommendations
- Results they experienced

Future customers read these reviews and come to your store specifically seeking Purrify.

Montreal stores have seen their Google review ratings improve AND their foot traffic increase after stocking Purrify.

At 40-60% margins, review-driven traffic is highly profitable.

Plus, better reviews help all your other sales too.

## Variation 39
**Subject:** Loss leaders vs profit drivers

Hi {{FirstName}},

Many stores use litter as a loss leader - low margin, high volume, drives traffic.

That's fine for commodity litter.

But Purrify is a profit driver, not a loss leader:
- 40-60% margins
- Premium pricing customers accept
- Repeat purchases every 4-6 weeks
- No need to discount

Montreal stores have found having both strategies works well:
- Loss leader litter brings customers in
- Profit driver Purrify makes the real money

You're already bringing in customers. Now maximize profit per customer.

Should we discuss adding a profit driver to {{StoreName}}'s litter category?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Variation 40
**Subject:** 90-day trial, zero risk

{{FirstName}},

I've sent 39 emails explaining why Purrify is great for {{StoreName}}.

But maybe you're still skeptical. That's fair.

Here's a no-risk proposition:

Start with a small initial order. If it doesn't sell within 90 days, we'll buy back unsold inventory.

Montreal stores took this same offer. Now 20+ of them reorder consistently because it sells itself.

At 40-60% margins with zero downside risk, there's no reason not to try.

What do you say - ready to give {{StoreName}} customers a solution that actually works?

Cheers,
[Your Name]
