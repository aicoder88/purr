## Variation 2
**Subject:** Does this sound familiar?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Montreal stores report near-zero returns and high repeat purchase rates. At 40-60% margins.

Montreal stores report it's consistently their most profitable shelf space.

Should we discuss optimizing {{StoreName}}'s space efficiency?

Best,

Sounds impossible, right?

But a Montreal store has exactly this situation. Competitor's staff buy Purrify there because their own store doesn't carry it.

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 36
**Subject:** Are skeptics your hardest customers?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Do you have customers who've "tried everything" and trust nothing?

Best,
[Your Name]

---

## Variation 40
**Subject:** What would zero-risk new product adoption look like?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Trying new products is risky. Shelf space is limited. Cash flow matters.

What if you could try something with zero downside?
