Subject: Quick follow-up on litter odor story for {{StoreName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up in case this is relevant for your audience at {{StoreName}}.

I can share a short, publication-ready package covering:
- science of activated carbon odor adsorption
- practical odor-control routine for cat owners
- source-backed notes your team can verify quickly

If this is better for another editor or desk, happy to send it there instead.

Thanks again,
