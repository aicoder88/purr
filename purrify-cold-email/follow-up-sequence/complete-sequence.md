# 5-Email Follow-Up Sequence for Purrify Cold Outreach

## Sequence Overview

**Purpose:** Systematic follow-up to initial cold email outreach
**Timeline:** 21 days total
**Goal:** Convert initial interest or overcome initial non-response

---

## EMAIL 1: Initial Outreach (Day 1)

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am local time

**Subject Options:**
- "{{FirstName}}, quick question about {{StoreName}}"
- "20+ stores, 40-60% margins, zero regrets"
- "Is litter box odor killing your store's reputation?"

**Email Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Quick question: How often do customers ask if you have something that actually WORKS for litter box smell?

I'm guessing weekly, if not daily.

Here's the challenge: Most products on your shelf don't actually eliminate odor - they just mask it or reduce it slightly.

Purrify is different. It's an activated coconut carbon additive that eliminates ammonia at the molecular level. No perfume. No harsh chemicals. Just actual odor elimination.

20+ pet stores in Montreal have made it a top-seller because:
- It actually works (customers come back for more)
- 40-60% profit margins
- Repeat purchases every 4-6 weeks
- Near-zero returns

We've helped stores transform their most frustrated customers into their most loyal ones.

Would 10 minutes on a call be worth exploring how this could work for {{StoreName}} in {{City}}?

## EMAIL 2: Value-Add (Day 4 - 3 days later)

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 2pm-3pm local time

**Subject Options:**
- "Case study: How one Montreal store added $18K annual profit"
- "Following up + sending you something useful"
- "{{FirstName}}, thought you'd find this interesting"

**Email Body:**

{{FirstName}},

I sent you a note earlier this week about Purrify - wasn't sure if it got buried.

Either way, I wanted to share something that might be useful even if we never work together.

**Case Study: Pierre's Pet Supply, Montreal**

Pierre was skeptical when he first stocked Purrify. "Another odor product," he thought.

But he agreed to try a small initial order and do a Saturday demo.

**Results:**
- Demo day: 67 bottles sold, $2,000+ revenue
- First month: Top 5 selling SKU
- Six months: 15-25% growth in entire litter category
- Year one: $18,000 additional profit from this one product

**Why it worked:**
1. Product actually delivers results (near-zero returns)
2. Demo converts at 95-100% because people can smell the difference
3. Customers repurchase every 4-6 weeks like clockwork
4. 40-60% margins maintained

**The surprise benefit:** Pierre's store smell improved noticeably. Customer browse time increased 30%. Google reviews started mentioning how "fresh and clean" the store was.

Would you be open to a brief call about whether this kind of result is possible for {{StoreName}}?

No pressure - just exploring if it's a fit.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If you want to see the demo in action, I can send you a video. It's pretty compelling.

## EMAIL 3: Social Proof + Urgency (Day 8 - 7 days from initial)

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am local time

**Subject Options:**
- "Your {{City}} competitors are asking about this"
- "Time-sensitive: Territory availability in {{City}}"
- "{{FirstName}}, limited availability update"

**Email Body:**

{{FirstName}},

Quick update - I've been reaching out to pet stores in {{City}} and getting strong interest in Purrify.

I want to give you first opportunity before we move forward with other stores in your area.

**Why this matters:**

We typically work with 1-2 stores per city initially. This creates:
- Local exclusivity (competitive advantage)
- Stronger word-of-mouth (customers seek you out specifically)
- Better support from us (focused attention)

**What other {{City}}/{{Province}} stores are saying:**

"Customers are driving 20 minutes past other pet stores to get to us now. They specifically ask for Purrify." - Store owner, [nearby city]

"We've captured the multi-cat household market in our area. These customers are incredibly loyal and spend 3-4x more." - Store owner, [nearby city]

"Our staff morale improved. Sounds weird, but solving the smell problem made everyone happier to work here." - Store owner, [nearby city]

**The offer:**

- Small initial order (low risk)
- 90-day buyback guarantee (zero downside)
- Demo kit and training included
- 40-60% margins from day one

**Next step:**

Let's schedule a 15-minute call this week or next. I'll walk you through:
- How other stores are positioning it
- Demo strategies that work
- Expected margins and turns

Are you available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If {{StoreName}} isn't the right fit, no worries. Just let me know so I can focus on other stores in {{City}}.

## EMAIL 4: Different Angle (Day 15 - 14 days from initial)

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am local time

**Subject Options:**
- "Wrong approach? (Re: {{StoreName}})"
- "{{FirstName}}, maybe I'm targeting the wrong problem"
- "Taking a different angle on this"

**Email Body:**

{{FirstName}},

I've sent you a few emails about Purrify - focusing on profit margins, customer loyalty, competitive advantage.

But I'm wondering if I've been targeting the wrong problem.

**Let me ask you something different:**

What's the ONE thing about running {{StoreName}} that frustrates you most right now?

Is it:
- Customer acquisition costs climbing?
- Competing with online retailers on price?
- Staff turnover and hiring challenges?
- Stagnant sales in core categories?
- Differentiating from big box stores?
- Something else entirely?

Because here's what I've learned from 20+ Montreal stores:

Purrify solves the obvious problem (customer need for odor elimination), but it also accidentally solves a bunch of other problems:

**Unexpected benefits stores report:**

1. **Staff retention:** Environment improves, turnover decreases
2. **Competitive moat:** Exclusive product differentiates from chains
3. **Customer lifetime value:** Repeat purchases create predictable revenue
4. **Category growth:** Litter sales increase 15-25% when odor is solved
5. **Review scores:** Google ratings improve when stores smell better
6. **Vet referrals:** Local vets recommend stores that carry it

Maybe one of these matters more to you than the profit margins (though those are solid at 40-60%).

If you're willing to share what problem you're actually trying to solve right now, I can be more specific about whether Purrify fits.

Or, if this just isn't a priority and I should stop emailing, I completely understand. Just let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

## EMAIL 5: Breakup Email (Day 22 - 21 days from initial)

**Timing:** Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-11am local time

**Subject Options:**
- "Breaking up is hard to do ({{StoreName}})"
- "Last email from me, {{FirstName}}"
- "Closing the loop on this"

**Email Body:**

{{FirstName}},

I've reached out a few times about Purrify for {{StoreName}}, and haven't heard back.

That's completely fine - I know inbox overload is real, and this might just not be a priority right now.

**Before I close the loop, one last thought:**

I talk to a lot of pet store owners. The ones who thrive are constantly testing new products, especially ones that:
- Solve real customer problems
- Offer healthy margins
- Create differentiation from big box stores

The ones who struggle are usually stuck in commodity battles with Chewy and PetSmart.

**Purrify might not be right for {{StoreName}} right now.** But the principle matters: Finding products that give you competitive advantage and profit margin breathing room.

**If you're ever looking for:**
- Solutions to customer problems (not just more commodity SKUs)
- Products with 40-60% margins (not 10-15%)
- Ways to differentiate from online and big box competition

I'm here. Just reach out.

**And if I'm completely off-base** and {{StoreName}} is thriving exactly as-is, then ignore everything I've said and keep doing what's working.

Either way, I wish you success.

This is my last email unless you reach out.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Title]

[Phone]
[Email]

P.S. - If you DO want to connect but timing is just bad right now, let me know when to follow back up. I'm happy to check in again in 3-6 months when you're less busy.

## Alternative Sequence Variations

### For Stores That Opened But Didn't Reply:

Replace Email 4 with:

"I noticed you opened my emails but haven't replied. Usually that means:
1. Not interested but too busy to say so
2. Interested but now's not the time
3. Need more information before replying

Which is it? I can adjust accordingly."

### For Stores That Clicked Links:

Replace Email 3 with:

"I saw you checked out [the case study/demo video/website]. What questions do you have? Let's skip the back-and-forth emails - would a 10-minute call be easier?"

---

**IMPORTANT:** Always track which email variation and subject line was used for each contact. This helps refine approach over time based on response data.
