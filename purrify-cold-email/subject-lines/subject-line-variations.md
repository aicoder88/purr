# Subject Line Best Practices & Testing Notes

## A/B Testing Recommendations:

**Test Set 1: Curiosity vs Direct Benefit**
- Curiosity: "The secret 20+ Montreal stores won't tell you"
- Benefit: "40-60% margins + loyal customers = this"

**Test Set 2: Question vs Statement**
- Question: "Is litter box odor killing your store's reputation?"
- Statement: "Stop losing customers to the smell"

**Test Set 3: Numbers vs Stories**
- Numbers: "20+ stores, 40-60% margins, zero regrets"
- Story: "What changed for pet stores in Montreal?"

**Test Set 4: Personal vs Generic**
- Personal: "{{FirstName}}, quick question about {{StoreName}}"
- Generic: "The product that sells itself"

## Personalization Token Guide:

- `{{FirstName}}` = Store owner's first name
- `{{StoreName}}` = Business name
- `{{City}}` = City where store is located
- `{{Province}}` or `{{State}}` = Location province/state

## Subject Line Length Guidelines:

- **Optimal:** 40-50 characters (shows fully on mobile)
- **Maximum:** 60 characters (may truncate on some devices)
- **Current variations:** 25-60 characters (optimized for visibility)

## Emoji Testing (Optional):

Some subject lines could be tested with emojis for specific segments:
- 🐱 "{{FirstName}}, are {{City}} cat owners avoiding you?"
- 💰 "$2,000 in one Saturday demo"
- ⭐ "20+ stores, 40-60% margins, zero regrets"
- 🎯 "Your {{City}} customers are searching for this"

**Recommendation:** Test with and without emojis. B2B recipients may respond better to professional tone without emojis.

## Timing & Day Testing:

**Best Send Times (B2B Pet Store Owners):**
- Tuesday-Thursday: 10am-11am local time
- Tuesday-Thursday: 2pm-3pm local time
- Avoid: Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, weekends

**Follow-up timing:**
- Wait 3-4 business days between emails
- Rotate subject line types (don't send two curiosity subjects in a row)

## Subject Line Rotation Strategy:

**Week 1:** Curiosity-driven
**Week 2:** Benefit-focused
**Week 3:** Question-based
**Week 4:** Stat/number-based
**Week 5:** Personalized

This prevents subject line fatigue and tests different psychological triggers.
