# Purrify SEO Landing Page Strategy

Based on analysis of Transcend.io's platform pages.

---

## URL Structure

Transcend uses simple, flat URLs. No deep nesting:

```
transcend.io/platform/consent-management
transcend.io/solutions/ai
transcend.io/solutions/enterprise
transcend.io/blog
transcend.io/customers
```

**Purrify should use:**
```
purrify.ca/ammonia-control
purrify.ca/odor-elimination
purrify.ca/multi-cat
purrify.ca/how-it-works
purrify.ca/ingredients
```

Simple, keyword-rich, one level deep. No `/solutions/for/concerns/` complexity.

### Priority 3: Comparison

---

## Page Structure

Every page follows this flow:

```
1. Hero (headline + subhead + CTA + image)
2. Trust bar (logos, ratings, "10,000+ customers")
3. Problem statement ("The Status Quo")
4. Solution introduction (how it works)
5. Three benefit pillars
6. Testimonial carousel
7. Statistics section (colored background)
8. FAQ accordion
9. Related content
10. Final CTA (contrasting background)
```

---

## Visual Design Specifications

### Image Count & Placement
Transcend uses **8-12 images per page**:
- 1 hero image (illustration or product screenshot)
- 3-6 section images (diagrams, illustrations, screenshots)
- Logo marquee (8-12 client/partner logos)
- Testimonial headshots (3-5)
- Icon set (6-9 feature icons at 48-80px)

**Visual rhythm:** An image appears every 2-3 text sections. Never more than 2 consecutive text-only sections.

**Image types used:**
- Product interface screenshots
- Abstract illustrations (not photos)
- Simple diagrams showing process/flow
- Geometric/pixelated abstract backgrounds for blog thumbnails
- NO generic stock photography

### Color Palette

Transcend's exact colors:
```
Primary CTA:        #5f5bf7 (deep purple)
Accent text:        #1c9ae1 (teal/cyan)
Light backgrounds:  #e8f4fc, #d2ebf9 (soft blues)
Section accents:    #efeefe, #f4f4f5 (light purple/gray)
Dark text:          #1c1c1e (near-black)
White:              #ffffff
```

**Why these colors work:**
- High contrast between purple CTAs and white backgrounds (instant visibility)
- Soft blue backgrounds break up white sections without competing
- Single accent color (purple) creates visual consistency
- Limited palette = professional, not chaotic

**Purrify adaptation:**
```
Primary CTA:        [Purrify brand green or teal]
Accent:             [Complementary warm color]
Light backgrounds:  Light mint, soft sage
Dark text:          #1c1c1e
```

### Section Background Pattern
```
Section                 Background
────────────────────────────────────
Hero                    White or subtle gradient
Trust bar               Light gray (#f8f9fa)
Problem statement       White
Solution intro          Light brand tint (#e8f4fc)
Feature pillars         White
Testimonials           Light brand tint
Statistics             Medium brand tint (#d2ebf9)
FAQ                    White
Related content        Light gray
Final CTA              Solid brand primary (#5f5bf7)
```

**Contrast creates rhythm.** Alternating white → tinted → white → tinted guides the eye down the page.

### Typography & Contrast

```
Headlines:     36-48px, dark (#1c1c1e), bold weight
Subheads:      24-28px, dark, medium weight
Body:          16-18px, dark gray (#333)
Captions:      14px, medium gray (#666)

On dark/purple backgrounds:
All text:      White (#ffffff)
```

### Visual Elements Beyond Images

**Icons:**
- 48-80px SVG icons
- Monochromatic (single color + white)
- Consistent line weight across all icons
- Placed above feature headlines

**Statistics display:**
- Large typography (48-72px for numbers)
- Colored background section
- 3-4 stats in a row
- Format: "7M+" not "7,000,000"

**Badges & tags:**
- "Verified" badges on testimonials
- G2/award recognition badges
- "Resource" or "Guide" tags on content cards
- Pill-shaped, subtle background color

**Cards:**
- Subtle drop shadows (not heavy)
- Rounded corners (8-16px radius)
- Light background tints
- NO heavy borders

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Solid purple, white text, rounded (pill shape)
- Secondary: Outlined or ghost style
- Hover: Slight color shift or lift effect

### Diagrams & Data Visualization

Transcend uses:
- Simple flow diagrams (3-5 steps)
- Before/after comparisons
- Statistics as large numbers (not charts)
- Icon + text feature grids

**They DON'T use:**
- Complex charts or graphs
- Detailed technical diagrams
- Infographic-style busy visuals

**For Purrify:**
- "How zeolite works" 3-step diagram
- Before/after odor timeline
- Comparison table (Purrify vs alternatives)

### Whitespace

Generous spacing throughout:
```
Between sections:     80-120px
Between elements:     24-40px
Card padding:         24-32px
Container max-width:  1200-1400px
```

More whitespace = more premium feel.

### Motion & Animation

Subtle, purposeful:
- Logo marquee: Continuous slow scroll
- Testimonial carousel: Manual or auto-advance
- FAQ accordion: Smooth expand (200-300ms)
- Scroll reveals: Fade-up on section entry
- Hover: Slight lift on cards (translateY -4px)

**NO:**
- Bouncy animations
- Parallax overuse
- Auto-playing video
- Distracting motion

## Content Strategy

### Problem-Solution Framing
Every page starts by establishing what's wrong with the status quo:

**Transcend pattern:**
> "Cookie banners are clumsy, incomplete solutions"
> "Semi-automated is not automated"

**Purrify application:**
> "Scented litters mask odor. They don't eliminate it."
> "Baking soda helps for a day. Zeolite works for a month."

### Three-Pillar Benefits
Always exactly three main benefits per page:

**Transcend:**
- Complete coverage / Seamless & scalable / Visibility & reporting

**Purrify:**
- Natural Science / Long-Lasting / Safe & Gentle
- Eliminates Odor / Saves Money / Easy to Use

### FAQ Structure
5-8 questions per page, ordered by buyer journey:
1. How does it work? (Understanding)
2. Is it safe? (Trust)
3. How do I use it? (Implementation)
4. What if it doesn't work? (Risk)
5. How is it different? (Comparison)
