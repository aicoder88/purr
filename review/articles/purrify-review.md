## What is Purrify Cat Litter?

[Purrify](https://www.purrify.ca/products) is a premium crystal cat litter made from silica gel that absorbs moisture and traps odors on contact. Unlike traditional clay litters that simply mask smells, Purrify's crystal technology actually eliminates odor-causing bacteria at the source.

The product was developed specifically for cat owners struggling with persistent litter box odors, particularly in multi-cat households or small living spaces where smell control is critical.

### Key Features

- **Crystal silica gel formula** - Superior absorption and odor elimination
- **99% dust-free** - Healthier for cats and humans
- **Low tracking** - Larger crystals stay in the box
- **Long-lasting** - One bag lasts 30+ days for one cat
- **Color-changing crystals** - Visual indicator when it's time to change
- **Unscented** - No artificial fragrances that can irritate cats

## Detailed Performance Analysis

### Odor Control: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is where **[Purrify cat litter](https://www.purrify.ca/products)** absolutely excels. Within 24 hours of switching from our previous clay litter, we noticed a dramatic reduction in litter box odor.

**Week 1 Results:**
- Urine odor: Virtually eliminated
- Feces odor: Significantly reduced (scooping still required)
- Room smell: Fresh, no litter box smell detectable

**Week 4 Results:**
- Maintained excellent odor control throughout the month
- No ammonia smell even with 3 cats
- Guests couldn't tell we had cats in the apartment

The crystal technology works by absorbing urine into the porous silica gel beads, which then trap and neutralize odor molecules. Unlike clay litters that become saturated and start to smell after a few days, Purrify maintained its effectiveness for the entire month.

**Comparison:** We've tested over 20 cat litters, and Purrify ranks #1 for odor control, surpassing even premium clumping litters like Dr. Elsey's and World's Best.

### Dust Levels: 4.5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

Purrify advertises as 99% dust-free, and our testing confirms this claim. When pouring the litter into the box, we observed minimal dust particles—a stark contrast to clay litters that create visible dust clouds.

**Benefits:**
- No dust settling on nearby furniture
- Better for cats with asthma or respiratory issues
- Cleaner air quality in the litter box area
- No dusty paw prints around the house

**Minor Note:** There is a very slight dust when cats dig vigorously, but it's negligible compared to traditional litters.

### Tracking: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The larger crystal size (approximately 3-5mm) significantly reduces tracking compared to fine-grain litters. However, some crystals do escape the box, particularly with our most enthusiastic digger.

**Our Observations:**
- 70% reduction in tracking vs. clay litter
- Crystals that do escape are easy to see and vacuum
- Using a litter mat caught most escapees
- Crystals don't stick to paws like clay

**Tip:** Pair Purrify with a quality litter mat for best results.

### Cat Acceptance: 4.5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

We were initially concerned about transitioning our cats from clay to crystals, but the switch was surprisingly smooth.

**Transition Timeline:**
- **Day 1-2:** All three cats investigated cautiously but used the box
- **Day 3-7:** Full acceptance, normal litter box behavior
- **Day 30:** Cats showed no preference for their old litter

**Important:** Some cats are texture-sensitive and may reject crystal litters. We recommend a gradual transition by mixing Purrify with your current litter over 7-10 days.

### Maintenance: 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Purrify is remarkably low-maintenance compared to clumping litters.

**Daily Routine:**
- Scoop solid waste (2 minutes)
- Stir crystals to distribute moisture (30 seconds)
- That's it!

**Monthly Routine:**
- Dispose of used litter
- Wash and dry litter box
- Refill with fresh Purrify

No more daily clump-scooping, no more heavy litter bags every week. The time savings alone make Purrify worth considering.

### Value for Money: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Price Breakdown:**
- One bag of Purrify: ~$25-30 (prices vary)
- Lasts 30+ days for one cat
- Cost per day: ~$0.85-1.00

**Comparison to Clay Litter:**
- Premium clumping clay: ~$15-20 per month
- Purrify: ~$25-30 per month
- **Difference:** $5-15 more per month

**Is it worth it?** For most cat owners, yes. The superior odor control, reduced tracking, and time savings justify the higher price. If you're currently buying premium clay litter anyway, the price difference is minimal.

**Cost-Saving Tip:** Check [Purrify's website](https://www.purrify.ca/) for bulk discounts and subscription options that can reduce the per-bag cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does one bag of Purrify last?

For one cat, a single bag typically lasts 30-40 days. For two cats, expect 15-20 days. Three cats will go through a bag in about 10-15 days. The longevity depends on your cats' habits and how frequently you stir the crystals.

### Is Purrify safe for kittens?

Yes, Purrify is safe for kittens over 8 weeks old. However, monitor young kittens to ensure they don't ingest the crystals. If your kitten has a habit of eating litter, wait until they outgrow this behavior before switching to crystal litter.

### Can I mix Purrify with my current litter?

Yes! We recommend a gradual transition by mixing 25% Purrify with 75% current litter for 3-4 days, then 50/50 for 3-4 days, then 75% Purrify for 3-4 days, before switching completely. This helps cats adjust to the new texture.

### Does Purrify work for multi-cat households?

Absolutely. We tested with three cats and found it performed excellently. The key is to have enough litter boxes (one per cat plus one extra) and to scoop solid waste daily.

### How do I know when to change the litter?

Purrify crystals change color (from white to yellow/tan) as they absorb urine. When about 80% of the crystals have changed color, it's time for a complete change. You'll also notice reduced odor control when the crystals are saturated.

### Is Purrify environmentally friendly?

Silica gel is not biodegradable, so it must be disposed of in the trash. However, because it lasts longer than clay litter, you're using less overall product and creating less waste. It's not the most eco-friendly option (corn or wood litters are better), but it's more sustainable than frequent clay litter changes.

### Can I flush Purrify down the toilet?

No, Purrify should never be flushed. Dispose of used litter in a sealed bag in your regular trash.

### Does Purrify have a scent?

No, Purrify is completely unscented. It doesn't mask odors with fragrances—it actually eliminates them. This is better for cats, who often dislike scented litters.
