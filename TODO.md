# SEO Follow-ups (SEMrush)

This TODO tracks remaining items from the latest SEMrush crawl after implementing fixes (hreflang, canonical, structured data, sitemaps, and llms.txt). Items marked [infra] are DNS/hosting configurations; [content] require copy/IA updates.

- [ ] DNS: Ensure `fr.purrify.ca` and `zh.purrify.ca` resolve correctly for all paths [infra]
  - Action: Verify A/ALIAS or CNAME in DNS and Vercel domain mappings for both subdomains.

- [ ] Re-crawl validation in SEMrush (full project) [ops]
  - Action: Trigger new crawl to confirm reductions for: hreflang conflicts, incorrect hreflang, multiple canonicals, temp redirects, invalid structured data.

- [ ] Slow page load: 1 page flagged [perf]
  - Likely heavy content page. Action: capture core web vitals on production and identify specific offenders (LCP/CLS/TTI). Optimize image sizes or defer non-critical sections further if needed.

- [ ] Low text-to-HTML ratio: 31 pages [content]
  - Action: add short, unique intro/outro copy to thin sections; ensure dynamic/utility pages are noindex where appropriate.

- [ ] Title too long: 2 pages [content]
  - Action: shorten titles to ~50â€“60 chars without truncation; confirm in each pageâ€™s Head/NextSeo.

- [ ] Missing/short titles: 8 pages [content]
  - Action: audit all routes with `NextSeo`/`Head` to ensure explicit `title`. (Most are covered; re-check after crawl.)

- [ ] Low word count: 2 pages [content]
  - Action: add supporting text (100â€“200 words) or set `noindex` if intentionally thin.

- [ ] Internal linking depth: 14 pages with one incoming link; 10 need >3 clicks to reach [content/IA]
  - Action: add Related Articles to Learn pages; add contextual links in product and support pages; ensure footer nav links include key leaf pages.

## Retailers Page & Menu Fixes

- [x] Retailers: After form submit, change confirmation copy to "we will get back to you within 72 hours".
- [x] Retailers: Update any approval/confirmation timing from 24 hours to 72 hours (e.g., "Approval 24hrs" badges/metrics).
- [x] Retailers: Change CTA copy to "Join 17 established Montreal and surrounding-area retailers already earning high margins with Purrify." (was "Join 17 established retailers...").
- [x] Header menu: Keep dropdowns open until user clicks outside or chooses another menu item; do not auto-dismiss too quickly.
- [x] Header menu: Ensure only one dropdown opens at a time and dropdowns donâ€™t overlap.

- [x] Retailers: Reduce excessive vertical spacing between sections by removing wrapper padding on the page and tightening section paddings (hero pb-16; wholesale/contact py-16).

## Email Delivery

- [x] Retailers application email: Ensure full, labeled form data is included in the email body (both plain-text and HTML), and add common template keys (`name`, `email`, `message`, `subject`, `date`) for compatibility.

## Performance Audit Notes & Next Steps

Notes (addressed now):
- [x] Header: Replaced inline JSX handlers with memoized callbacks to avoid re-creation on every render (JS-0417).
- [x] Header: Added stable button `id` to match `aria-labelledby` on dropdown, improving a11y.
- [x] Cache handler: Removed unnecessary `return await` in async wrapper (JS-0111) while preserving error handling.
- [x] Global: Standardized `catch (err)` naming to avoid shadowing and reduce confusion.

Next steps (proposed):
- [ ] Products grid: Replace inline handlers in `src/components/sections/products.tsx` with memoized callbacks (JS-0417) [perf].
- [ ] Blog cards: Replace inline handlers in `src/components/sections/blog-preview.tsx` and `pages/blog/index.tsx` (JS-0417) [perf].
- [ ] Enable ESLint rules and auto-fixes: `no-return-await`, `react/jsx-no-bind`, `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` (warn first), then clean remaining manually [tooling].
- [ ] TypeScript: Trial `noUnusedLocals` / `noUnusedParameters` in a branch; measure impact and fix hotspots (JS-0356) [perf].
- [ ] A11y: Re-scan for interactive-role mismatches; ensure only semantic roles are used and `aria-*` pairs are valid [a11y].
- [ ] RegExp: Review any flagged `.match/.exec` patterns; prefer `regex.test` for boolean checks and ensure global flags are correct (JS-D007) [perf].
- [ ] Re-run perf/static analysis after above changes; capture deltas and prioritize any remaining high-count rules [qa].

Context / exclusions:
- Built assets like `public/sw-optimized.js` may include `return await`â€”treat as generated code; exclude from lint or address at build step if needed.
