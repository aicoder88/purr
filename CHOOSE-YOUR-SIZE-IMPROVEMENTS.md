# "Choose Your Perfect Size" Section - Light/Dark Mode Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Original Problems**
1. **Text behind images**: Size badges were positioned inside image containers, causing visibility issues
2. **Poor dark mode support**: Images didn't display well against dark backgrounds  
3. **Low text contrast**: Some text was hard to read in both light and dark modes
4. **Card visibility**: Cards lacked sufficient contrast boundaries in dark mode

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 🖼️ **Image Display Optimization**
- **White background layer**: Added `bg-white/95 dark:bg-white/98` behind images for consistent contrast
- **Improved sizing**: Increased image container from 160px to 180px min-height for better visibility
- **Enhanced shadows**: Added `shadow-inner` and `drop-shadow-sm` for depth and definition
- **Better positioning**: Moved size badges completely outside image containers to prevent overlap

### 🏷️ **Badge & Text Positioning** 
- **Size badges relocated**: Moved from `absolute top-2 right-2` inside container to `absolute -top-2 -right-2` outside
- **Enhanced visibility**: Added white borders and drop shadows to badges
- **Z-index management**: Proper layering with `z-20` for badges and `z-10` for images

### 🌙 **Dark Mode Enhancements**
- **Card borders**: Added `border-gray-100 dark:border-gray-600` for better definition
- **Background improvements**: Enhanced dark backgrounds from `dark:bg-gray-700` to `dark:bg-gray-800` 
- **Shadow enhancements**: Improved dark mode shadows with `dark:shadow-black/30`
- **Ring colors**: Stronger ring colors for popular products `dark:ring-[#FF3131]/50`

### 📝 **Text Contrast Improvements**
- **Headings**: Changed from `dark:text-gray-100` to `dark:text-white` for better contrast
- **Brand colors**: Enhanced red color in dark mode from `text-[#FF3131]` to `dark:text-[#FF5555]`
- **Feature text**: Improved from `dark:text-gray-300` to `dark:text-gray-200` with `font-medium`
- **Stats section**: Added `font-medium` to all stat labels for better readability
- **Button text**: Fixed button text contrast with `dark:text-white`

### 🔧 **Code Quality Fix**

## 📱 **Responsive Improvements**
- Better text sizing across breakpoints (`text-sm sm:text-base`)

- ✅ **Enhanced text readability**: Improved contrast ratios for all text elements
- ✅ **Better card definition**: Clear boundaries and shadows in both modes
