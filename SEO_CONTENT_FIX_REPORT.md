### 2. Multiple H1 Tags - FIXED

Fixed **4 pages** with multiple H1 tags by converting error state headings to h2:

| Page | Issue | Fix |
|------|-------|-----|
| `app/refer/[code]/ReferralClient.tsx` | 2 H1s (main + error state) | Changed error state to h2 |
| `app/admin/seo/page.tsx` | 2 H1s (main + access denied) | Changed access denied to h2 |
| `app/affiliate/AffiliateContent.tsx` | 2 H1s (main + error state) | Changed error state to h2 |
| `app/affiliate/signup/SignupContent.tsx` | 2 H1s (main + error state) | Changed error state to h2 |

---

### 3. Meta Description Issues

Most description issues were in schema definitions (acceptable to be shorter). The main page descriptions were already optimized in the `seo-meta.ts` file.

**Key findings:**
- 133 short descriptions found in `seo-meta.ts` - these are primarily schema JSON-LD descriptions
- Schema descriptions don't need the 120-155 character limit as they're for structured data, not SERP display

## SEO Impact

### Positive Impacts:
1. **Better SERP Display**: All page titles now fit within Google's 60-character display limit
2. **No Truncation**: Titles won't be cut off in search results

4. **Consistent Branding**: All titles include "Purrify" or "${SITE_NAME}" suffix

### CTR Improvements:

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor CTR**: Track changes in click-through rates in Google Search Console

3. **Resubmit to GSC**: Request re-indexing of modified pages
4. **Schema Descriptions**: Consider expanding schema descriptions for better rich snippet display
