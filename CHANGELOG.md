## [2025-01-08] - Dark Mode & UX Fixes Session

### Issues Found
1. **Critical Dark Mode Text Issues**: 100+ instances of text that was unreadable in dark mode
   - `text-gray-700`, `text-gray-600`, `text-gray-900` classes without `dark:` variants
   - Systematic problem across components: how-it-works, shopping-cart, testimonials, features, case-studies, reviews
   - User reported: "Gently mix it into the top layer of the litter for maximum effectiveness" was too dark

2. **Poor UX Interaction Timing**
   - Dropdown menus disappearing too quickly (150ms timeout) - hard to navigate to sub-pages
   - Purchase notifications showing too frequently (15-25 seconds) - annoying users

3. **Legal Risk from Brand Names**
   - Direct competitor mentions: "Purrify vs Arm & Hammer" in content
   - Risk of trademark/legal issues

### Changes Made

#### Dark Mode Text Fixes
- `src/components/sections/how-it-works.tsx`: 
  - Line 72: Added `dark:text-gray-300` to subtitle text
  - Line 123: Added `dark:text-gray-300` to step descriptions (fixes reported issue)

#### Brand Name & Legal Compliance
- `src/data/blog-posts.ts`:

  - Line 27: To "Activated Carbon vs Baking Soda Cat Litter Additives: Complete Comparison"
